you know , one of the great conversations in travel and one of the pleasures of ethnic research is to live together with the people that are still reminded in the old days . the past is still feeling in the wind , touching stones
just knowing that juar habitat is still traveling beyond the milky way or the meaning of myths of the inuit of the inuit , or that in the himalayas , the buddhist is still the breath of the pharmaceuticals
and of course , we all share the same adaptation .
we &apos;re all born . we bring children to the world .
we go through infection .
we need to go through death from death , and so we shouldn &apos;t surprise us that we &apos;re all singing and dancing and art .
but interestingly , the unique toss of the song , the rhythm of dance in every culture .
it doesn &apos;t matter whether it &apos;s about the penis of borneo , or the automobiles in haiti , or the warriors in the cabinet desert of north asia , the candidate of north asia , or a karajan in
all these people teach us that there are other existence , other ways of thinking , other ways of orientation on earth .
and that &apos;s an idea that if you think about it , you can just fulfill it with hope .
together , the livestock cultures of the world are a web of spiritual and cultural life that distinguishes the earth , and for the wealthy of the earth , is as important as the biological habitat that you know as a biosphere .
you can imagine this cultural habitat as a spaceship . spaceship can be as the entire total thought and dreams , myths , ideas and intuitions that have been determined by human imagination since the beginnings of consciousness .
the spaceship is the great legacy of humanity .
it &apos;s the symbol of all the things we are and what we are capable of as an amazing personal species .
and just like the biosphere got strong , this happened with the spaceshipal -- only with higher speed .
no biologist would say , for example , 50 percent or more of all sorts of things are extinct , because it &apos;s just not true , and yet , this -- the apple table scenario in the field of biological diversity -- is very much
and the crucial indicator for this is the extinction of languages .
when each of you was born in this room , on earth , on earth 6,000 languages were talked .
now , a language is not just the entire vocabulary or a series of grammar of grammar .
language is expression of the human mind .
it &apos;s a tool that is finding the soul of a specific culture access to the material world .
every language is like an old-fashioned forest of the mind , a turning point , a thought , an ecosystem of spiritual possibilities .
and of those 6,000 languages today , as we sit here in monterey , only half of those are whispering into the ears of children .
they don &apos;t taught kids anymore . that means when nothing is done , they &apos;re actually dead .
what could be lonely than the silence to be one of the last of the people who speak your language , no way to have the wisdom of the ancestors , or expect the hope of children ?
and yet this horrible fate actually disappears someone on earth , about every two weeks , because every two weeks , an elderly person dies and takes the last side of an old language to the grave .
and i know some of you say , &quot; isn &apos;t it better ? &quot; wouldn &apos;t the world be a better place if we were all going to talk a language ? &quot; and i say , &quot; well , let &apos;s be this language of yoruba
let &apos;s be cogiid . &quot;
and then suddenly they would see what it would be if they couldn &apos;t speak their own language .
so i &apos;d like to take you to a journey today through the spaceship , a short journey through the spacescore to try to understand what was actually lost .
now there are some of us who kind of forget for me to say , &quot; different possibilities of being , &quot; really different possibilities of being .
for example , take this child of the baraaa in the northwest of the amazon , the people of the hava , believe that she came up with mythology of the east in the stomach of sacred snakes .
this is a people who distinguish cognitively between the colors of blue and green because the sky is in the forest that depends on people .
you have a curious language , and a marry dictionary called the linguistical exagger : you have to marry someone who speaks to a different language .
all of this is rooted in the mythilogical past . the curious thing about these big houses where the numbers of six or seven languages are talked about , but though you never hear somebody learn a language .
they just listen and start talking .
or , one of the most amazing tribes that i &apos;ve ever lived with , the minorani in the northwest of ecuador , is an amazing people that first passed peaceful in 1958 .
and in 1957 , five missionary contact was coming up and made a tough mistake .
they watched shiny photographs from the air , which we were going to judge as a friendly gesture , and they were formed that these people from the rainforest in their lives had never seen any two-dimensional on their lives .
they raised these photographs from the forest floor , trying to see behind the face or the character , and they didn &apos;t find anything and conclusive that these were the traditions of the devil and killed the five missionary of the spears .
but the watorani didn &apos;t just kill the views with the spears .
they were passing each other .
fifty percent of deaths happened through pollution .
we went back to the geniology eight generations , and we found two cases of a natural death , and when we asked people about printing , they gave them a little bit of time that he died because of his age , and we were still
but at the same time , they had a clear knowledge of the forest that was amazing .
their hunters were able to smell the urine of an animal from 40 steps away and determine what animal art is .
in the early &apos; 80s , i got a really amazing task when my professor at harvard asked me whether i was interested in going to haiti and infected the secret societies that were the foundation of the style of duce and sound
so , to give a sense of this conversation , i had to of course talk about these remarkable beliefs of vodou knowledge and chocolate is not a cult of black magic .
on the contrary , it &apos;s a complex metaphysical world view .
it &apos;s interesting .
if i asked you to count the big world religions , what would you say ?
christianity , islam , buddhism , judism , whatever .
a continent is always left , because the guess was that in sub-saharan africa , there was no religious belief , of course , and of course there was one and a vocalooch of this very profound religious thought that was crossing during the
but what may be so interesting is this living relationship between the living and the dead .
the living gave birth to the spirits .
the spirits can be involved from the big water , answers to the rhythm of dance to promote the soul of the living , so that the foolth for a brief moment becomes the god .
prohabies like to say , &quot; your white walks into the church and talking about god .
we dance in the temple , and we become god . &quot;
and because you &apos;re obsessed , you &apos;re going to take off the mind . how can you be added to damage ?
look at this amazing demonstration : nuclear autonomy in a root station , the shining coal without burn , an amazing illustration of the capacity of the mind to affect the body that it holds when it gets locked into a state
now , from all the people i &apos;ve met , the cogium from sierra nevada de santa marta in northern columbia , the most remarkable .
according to the old tyranian civilization that spread the cartoon coast of columbia , and in contradiction , this people moved into an isolated vulnerability massive back over the cartoon of coast .
in a bloodline of continent , these people were the only ones that have never been embedded by spanish .
to the day today , they &apos;re governed by a ritual priest , but the priest education is very extraordinary .
the young acsons is separated by the age of three and four years from their families , and in a shadowful world of the fingers , in stockpeges for 18 years , they took two years from nine years , sustainability elected
and during all this time , they &apos;re going to introduce culturally into the values of their society , values that sustain the claims that their prayers and only their prayers , the cosmic -- or we could say the ecological -- the
at the end of this amazing initiation , one day , you &apos;ll suddenly take out , and for the first time in your life , in the age of 18 , you see a sunrise . and in this crucial moment of consciousness , the sun
it &apos;s so wonderful . you have to protect it . &quot;
they call the older brothers , and they say that we are responsible for the younger brothers to be responsible for destruction of the world .
now this level of intuition becomes very important .
every time we think about an indigenous and landscape , we either construct rouses and the old fear of the noble wild , which is a very distinctive thought , or or say , these people are more connected to nature than we are .
so , indians are not sensory , yet they &apos;re still going from nestal .
there &apos;s not a lot of space for this in malaria pollution or the cold winds of tibet , but they still have a mysterious group of the earth , which is not based on the idea of being aware , but on a very subtle
now , what does that mean ?
it means that a young child is growing up in the belief that the mountain is an apparatus , which is one or her fate , will become a very different person , and have another relationship with this resource , as a small child from
whether it &apos;s an immigrant of a mind or a pile , is irrelevant .
and the interesting thing is the metaphor that defines the relationship between the individual and nature .
i grew up in the woods of british columbia and believed that these forests are going to be taken up .
and that made me to another human being as my friends under the kelp , who believe that these forests of the incubator and the biased skyscrapers , and the canniby spirals , are living in the north of the world ,
now , when you start looking at the idea that these cultures can create different realities , you can understand some of their extraordinary discoveries , for example , that plant here .
it &apos;s a photograph i took last april last april in the northwest amazon .
this is ayahuia , which many of you have heard , the strongest psychoactive preparation from the repertoire of harmful .
what ayahuvas does so fascinating is not just the pharmaceutical potential of this preparation , but the process . it &apos;s actually made of two different sources . on the one hand , there are these wooden limbs , a series of
this plant contains some very strong drillines that are very similar to the serotonin , dressed hypothermia 5 and metalxy hypothermia .
if you &apos;ve seen the yomami , as you &apos;ve seen this stuff , this substance that you make from different types also contain hypoxic hypothermia .
and so , this powder is going to be a little bit like a route of rhetoric , from barbie paintings , and the landing on an ocean of electricity .
it &apos;s not going to make any distortion of reality , but the resolution of reality .
i even have with my professor , richard evan shrimp , the man who took the psychedelic journal with the discovery of the magical mushrooms in mexico in the 30 years , discussing that that you couldn &apos;t be able to put
but the thing about alphabet is that they can &apos;t be implemented , because it &apos;s of course by one in the human gmm of the name of monoam oecne , which is detected .
you can only get involved with some other chemicals that are devoted to mao .
now the fascinating thing is that the tax line , which is in liane , are mao sauce of exactly the way that needs to make the poetry , so ask yourself .
how can these people find from a flag of 80,000 species of appropriate plants that have two mores of not related plants that , if they combine this way , create a kind of biochemical version , so that &apos;s greater than the sum of
we use this great euphemism , trying and mistakes , which makes sense as meaningless .
but you ask the indians , you say , &quot; the plant speaks to us . &quot;
so , what does that mean ?
this tribe , the caran , has 17 varieties of ayahastu , which you can all see at great distance in the forest that appears for our eyes as a way .
and then you ask them how to start their taxonomy , and they say , &quot; i thought you understand some plants .
i mean , don &apos;t you know anything ? &quot; and i said , &quot; no . &quot;
well , it turns out that every one of the 17 variants in full moon , and they sing to one in a different proposition .
well , that doesn &apos;t get a ph.d. at harvard , but it &apos;s much more interesting than stamina .
now , the problem is that even those among us who have sympathy for the difficult situation of indians , they look at them as organ and colorly , but they &apos;re somehow limited to the past , as the real world , the way our
so , the fact is that you &apos;re not going to remember the 20th century , in 300 years , for its wars or technical innovations , but more than an era where we were against , and the massive destruction of biological and cultural diversity on
all cultures have been involved in the dance with new life possibilities .
and the problem is not the technology itself .
the sioux indians were not listening less to sioux when they were bowing bow and arrow , when the americans stopped being listening to americans when they were doing horse and horses .
no change and technology threatens the integrity of the spaceshipal . it &apos;s power . the ugly face of the regime .
and wherever you &apos;re looking around in the world , you &apos;ll discover that these cultures are not the conversation . these are dynamically living peoples that are determined by their capacity for adaptation , whether it &apos;s about an exhibition in the
or if we go into the mountains of tibet , where i work in new ways , you will see the ugly face of political domination .
you know , the genocide , the physical extinction of people , is being convicted in general , but the ethnicity , the destruction of the people &apos;s lives , is not just being convicted , but more generally and more common
and you can &apos;t understand tibetan if you haven &apos;t experienced it at first .
i used to travel with a young colleague 6,000 miles of cry in west america through southern tibet to l.a. tibet , and only when i came to lhaa , i saw the face of the statistics you hear . 6,000
the father of this young man was identified as followers of the pack lama .
that meant that during the chinese invasion he was immediately killed .
his uncle flew with her holiness in the diaspora , who brought people to nepal .
his mother was locked in , as a punishment for -- to be prosperous for crime .
he was encouraged at the age of two in the age of two to hide himself under her rock , because she couldn &apos;t live .
the sister who did this borer was brought into an educational camp .
and one day she came out of courts , and she had to have mao , and for this transition , she had to go into a hard work camp for seven years .
that suggests tibert can be awesome , but the steady spirit of people is something unforgettable .
and at the end of the day , we &apos;re really in front of a choice . would we like to live in an monchroatic world of the monstery world , or a polymeric world of diversity ?
margaret mell , the great anthropologist before she died , is that while we &apos;re moving towards a fake , robust , general world view , we wouldn &apos;t only see the entire bandwidth of human imagination in a very intense way ,
and it &apos;s humbling to think that our species may have been there for 600,000 years .
the neural revolution that brought us agriculture , and in this moment the cult of the saturn of the satellite , the poetry of the shame , released the poetry of the priesthood and hierarchy , specialization and translation
the modern industrial world as we know it is almost 300 years old .
well , this superficial story is not telling me that we all have answers to the challenges that we &apos;re facing in the coming millennia .
if we ask these unprecedented world cultures to be the meaning of human beings , they answer with 10,000 different voices .
and in this song , we &apos;re going to be able to get the opportunity to be what we are : people with full consciousness that are aware of the importance of all people and gardens to be able to flourish , and there &apos;s great moments
here &apos;s a photograph that i took up at the northern end of the burn island when i went to the nail hunt , and this man , goya told me a wonderful story of his grandfather .
the canadian government is not always very good with the inuit , and during the 50 years in the process of exploring our regime , they were forced to pull in settlements .
the grandfather of this old man refused .
the family who had fear about his life took him all weapons and all the tools .
now you have to know that the inuit has no fear of the cold . they used them to their advantage .
they were created by fish in caribllo in caribland originally .
the man &apos;s grandfather didn &apos;t care about the arctic night or the soft storm .
and he went outside , made his pants from the iron screen down and degraded in his hand , and when the feces started to divide , he turned them into the form of a measureer .
he jumped saliva on the sides of the fecal , and when it was completely frozen , he &apos;s going to get a dog with it .
he announced the dog and improved a tranr , took the skeleton of the dog and improved a smile , and he took another dog and determined the pollen knife with the fecal knife on the beach .
you can &apos;t do anything like that .
and this is a symbol of a symbol of the inuit and all the indians in the world .
the canadian government gave the inuit in april 1999 to complete complete control of an area that &apos;s bigger than california and texas .
it &apos;s our new homeland , and it &apos;s called the navut .
it &apos;s an independent area . they control all mines .
it &apos;s an amazing example of how one nation , a state that can release revenue with his people .
and finally , i think it &apos;s pretty obvious , at least for those of us who have traveled to these distant goals of the earth , to realize that they &apos;re not removed at all .
they are the home countries of someone .
they represent parts of human imagination that pass back in past times , and for all of us , the dreams of these children become part of the dreams of our own children participating in the geography of hope .
ultimately , what we &apos;re trying to do at national geographic is that we believe that politicians never achieve anything .
we believe that polea -- we believe that poledy is not convinced , but we believe that stories can change the world , and so we &apos;re probably the best institution for stories in the world . our website gets 35 million bits every month
fifty nations send our tv channel .
our magazines are read by millions .
and we &apos;re doing a series of travel in the spaceship where we take our audience to places of these cultural wonderes , and hopefully they &apos;re going to take one after the central revelation of anthropology : that this world deserves to exist
thank you .
what i first will show you , as quickly as possible , is the basic work , a new technology that we have microsoft as part of a year , and that &apos;s separation , and it &apos;s an environment where you either can either deal with
we see many , many obstacles on digital photographs here that you can get close and over and over and over .
and it doesn &apos;t matter how many information we &apos;re looking at , how big these collections are , or how big the images are .
most of them are digital photographs of a camera , but this one is a scan from the conservation library , and it &apos;s in a region of 300 megatoxs .
it doesn &apos;t matter because the only thing the performance of a system can contain is the number of pixels on your screen in every moment . it also has a very flexible architecture .
this is a whole book , an example of non-data data .
this is reak house from dickens . every column is chapter .
to prove that it &apos;s really about a text and not about a picture , we can actually do something like this , to really show that this is a real representation of the texts and not a picture .
maybe this is an artificial way of reading a book book .
i wouldn &apos;t recommend it .
this is a realistic case . this is a copy of the guardian .
every big picture is the beginning of an average .
and that gives you really the pleasure and the good experience of reading a real picture of a magazine or newspaper , which is a kind of medium with multiple scales .
we also did something at the corner of this particular copy of the guardian .
we designed a false dissolution with very high resolution , which is much higher than a normal display , and we added additional content .
if you want to see the functions of these cars , you can see them here .
or other models , or even technical specs .
and this really takes these ideas to make these constraints available for the available place on the screen .
we hope that this is no longer a pop-up and other nonsense anymore -- that should not be necessary .
of course , the map is one of the really obvious applications for a technology like this .
and i don &apos;t really want to spend a lot of time here , except to say that we &apos;re going to contribute to this area too .
but these are all the streets in the u.s.
interpretation at the top of the spike of nasa .
now , let &apos;s get it out here .
so this is actually live on the internet . you can check it out .
this is a project called photosynthesis that really connects two different technologies together .
one is selective , and the other is a very good research on computer vision , which from noah snaffy , a university student at the university of washington , under the advice of steve quartz .
and rick dtiski was done by microsoft research , very good collaboration .
so this is live on the internet . it &apos;s driven by september .
you can see that when we create these kinds of views where we can go through images and make this experience of resolution .
but the spatial order of the images is actually important .
the computer vision algorithms have put these pictures together so they put the real room in which these images , which were all done near the massive lake in the canadian rockets in the canadian rockets , and you see elements of
i don &apos;t know exactly if i have time to show you other environments .
there are those who are much more spatial .
i &apos;d like to show you just one of the original data sets of noah , and this is from a early prototype of photosynthesis that we first worked in the summer to show you what i think is really the punch of the technology
we had to worry about the lawyers and everything .
this is a reconstruction of the cathedral unified lady , who was just in the computer with images of flickr , and they &apos;re just giving unrelevant lady in flickr , and they &apos;re getting pictures of men in t-shirts
so these are all flickr pictures , and all of them are in this way in relation to each other .
and we can navigate in this very simple way .
you know , i never believed i &apos;m going to work at microsoft eventually .
i &apos;m very grateful for the receptor here .
and i guess you can see that these are many different types of cameras : everything is from the cell phone to professional rule , a pretty large number of them that were all cracked together in this environment .
and if possible , i &apos;ll find some of the strange ones .
many of them are degraded by faces , etc .
there are a series of photographs here -- here they are .
this is actually a poster of unrelevant dame , which was right recorded .
we can shift from the poster to a physical view of this environment .
the point here is that we can do things with social environments . it &apos;s now collected data from everyone -- from the whole collective memory of what , visual the earth -- and it &apos;s all connected to each other .
all these pictures are connected , and there &apos;s something bigger than the sum of the parts .
you get a model that comes from all over the earth .
consider this as the sequel of stephen lawler on virtual earth .
and this is something that is growing by the complexity that people use , and they use their use to use the user to use using application .
their own photographs are complained by metaphors that have one other person .
when someone was making the trash , and they laid all of this sacred , and share who they are all , and then my photograph of the unrelevant dame cathedral is suddenly being able to use all of this data , and
and of course , byproduct of all of these are the immense virtual models of every interesting part of the earth that was not only given by overall or satellite images and so on , but by collective memory .
thank you .
do i understand it right ? your software enables that at some point in the next year , all the images that are used by someone in the world are basically being connected to each other ?
yes . it doesn &apos;t make anything else as discovering .
if you want to create hyperlinks between the images .
and she does this because of the content in the images .
and that &apos;s really exciting if you think about the footprint of the semantical information that many of these images have .
like if you take a web search for images where you put sentences and the text of the website contains a lot of information about what image is .
but what if that image is connected to you with all your pictures ?
then the volume of semantical jellyfish and the footen that makes out of it is really enormous . it &apos;s a classic network network .
blaise , that &apos;s really incredible . heart congratulations .
thank you very much .
i &apos;m going to tell you some things from my book , which , like i hope , is in the unison with other things that you &apos;ve heard already , and i &apos;m going to try to make a couple of connections , if you haven &apos;t
i want to start with what i call official pramama .
the official poison of what ?
official faith of all western industrialized societies .
the official dogma works like this : if our goal is maximum the theme of our citizens , this is especially by the maximum freedom of the individual .
the reason for this is that freedom is good in itself , valuable , meaningful , an unrational preconception for human .
when people have freedom , each of us is for themselves to do things that our main maximum , and no one has to decide for us .
the way freedom to maximize is to maximize choice .
the more choices people have , the more freedom they have , and the more freedom they have , the more good they have .
this is , i think , profoundly in our food supply , that it &apos;s not going to come in mind .
and it &apos;s also deeply rooted in our lives .
so i &apos;m going to give you some examples of what modern progress allows us .
this is my supermarket . it &apos;s not a big deal .
i just want to just say a little bit about sighted .
there are 175 singers in my supermarket , if you don &apos;t count the 10 different open olive oil oil , and 12 car oil stores that you could buy to make a large number of their own slopes , in the unlikely case
so that &apos;s what the supermarket is .
and then they go to the consumer electronics business to hide a stereo -- speakers , c-players , a ceremony player , radio , amplification , and in this one electronic store , there are so many stereo
we can put 6.5 million different stereo accurately out of the components that are offered in this business .
you have to admit that this is a big choice .
in other areas -- the world of communication .
there was a time when i was a boy , and you could have every telephone that you wanted , as long as it came from ma bell .
they hit their phone . they didn &apos;t buy it .
one of them was that the phone was never broken .
these days are over .
we now have almost an infinite choice of phones , especially in the world of mobile phones .
these are the mobile phones of the future .
my favorite is that in the middle -- mp3 player , nasen haarnode , and crème brahns &apos;s face .
and if you haven &apos;t seen that in your business yet , you can be sure you &apos;ll soon be able to .
and what it does is it makes people walk into business and ask that question .
do you know what the answer to that question ?
the answer is no . &quot;
it &apos;s not possible to buy a mobile phone that doesn &apos;t do too much .
in other aspects of life that are much more significant than buying objects , the same explosion of choice is true .
health care -- it &apos;s no longer the case in the united states that you go to the doctor , and the doctor tells you what to do .
instead , they go to the doctor , and the doctor says to them , we could make a , or we could make b .
a has these benefits and risks .
b has these benefits and risks . what do you want to do ?
and they say , &quot; doctor , what should i do ? &quot;
the doctor says , a has these benefits and risks and b have those benefits and risks .
what do you want to do ?
and if you say , &quot; if you were , doctor , what would you do ? &quot;
the doctor says , &quot; but i &apos;m not her . &quot;
the result is -- we call it &quot; patient autonomy , &quot; which sounds like a good thing , but in reality , there is a shift in the location of the responsibility for someone who knows something about -- the doctor -- to someone who is
there &apos;s an enormous marketing for prescription drugs for people like you and me , that if you think about it , nothing makes any sense because we don &apos;t buy them .
why are they doing around us if we can &apos;t buy ?
and the answer is , you expect to call the ph.d. in the next morning and ask a change of prescription .
something as profound as our identity is now a question of choice , like this slide .
we don &apos;t inherit identity ; we invent them .
and we tend to invent as often as we want .
that means every day when you wake up in the morning , you need to decide what kind of person you want to be .
in terms of marriage and family , there was a time where the standard assumption was that almost everybody had one and they were getting married as fast as they could , and then kids were getting so fast as they could .
the only real choice was &quot; who , &quot; not when , and not what they did after that .
today , everything is easy to have .
i teach wonderful intelligent students , and i give them 20 percent less work than i used to do .
and that &apos;s not because they &apos;re less smart , and not because they &apos;re less careful .
it &apos;s because they &apos;re busy with other things , they ask themselves , &quot; should i marry or not ? should i marry ?
should i get married later ? should i have children or make a career ? &quot;
they &apos;re all questions .
and you &apos;re going to answer these questions consciously , whether it means all the tasks that i &apos;m saying to you and not get good grades in my class .
and indeed they should . these are important questions .
work -- we &apos;re blessed , as carl has suggested , with technology that allows us to work every minute of every day on the planet -- to the randi hotel .
and by the way , there &apos;s a corner that i &apos;m not going to tell you about in terms of wireless .
i &apos;m not going to tell you because i want to use it .
so what it means is this incredible freedom of choice we have in terms of making decisions , again and again , whether we should work or not work .
we can look at our children in the football , and we have our mobile phone on a hip , and our blackberry on other hip , and our laptop probably on our lap .
and even though they &apos;re all turned off , every minute we &apos;re going to look at our child in the mutilation of a football game , we also ask ourselves , &quot; should i take that call ?
should i respond to this email ? should i write this letter ? &quot;
and even when the answer to the question &quot; no , &quot; it certainly will be your experience of football players very differently than it would have been .
everywhere we look , big things and small things , material things and lifestyle , life is a matter of choice .
and the world we lived in looked like this .
so i want to say that there were some options , but not all was a matter of choice .
and the world we live in now looks like this .
and the question is , are the good news or bad news ?
the answer is yes .
we all know what &apos;s good about it , so i &apos;m going to be bad about what &apos;s wrong .
all of these choices have two effects , two negative effects on people .
an effect , paradoxically , is that he &apos;s paralyzed instead of free .
with so many options you can choose , people are very hard to decide .
i &apos;m going to give you another dramatic example of this , a study of investments in volunteers of volunteers .
a colleague of mine had access to investment actions of vague , the giant consumer society of about a million employees and about 2,000 different jobs .
and what she found was a $ 10 investment the employee advice , took the participation by two percent .
you offer 50 investment funds -- 10 percent less employees take part as if you would offer five . why ?
because it &apos;s 50 investment funding , it &apos;s so hard to decide which one you should choose to put it in the morning .
and then tomorrow , and then tomorrow , and tomorrow , and tomorrow , and tomorrow never comes .
understand that this is not only that people have to eat dog food when they go to retirement , because they don &apos;t have enough money to go back , it means that they make decisions so hard that they miss large investment chains of their
through the uniform , they give up to 5,000 dollars a year on from the worker who would have been happy to enhance their contributions .
paralysis is a consequence of many options .
and i think it makes the world look like this .
they want to really meet the decision if it &apos;s all forever , right ?
they don &apos;t want to choose the wrong investment forever , or even the wrong slower .
so this is one effect . the other effect is that even if we get over the paralysis and make a decision , we end less happiness with the result of choice than if we had the opportunity to decide between less possibilities .
and there are several reasons for this .
one of them is driven by the big choice of different sighted singers , when you buy one , and it &apos;s not perfect -- and what shatters is perfect ? it &apos;s easy to imagine that you could have made a different decision that
the more possibilities there are , the easier it is not at all to regrets that is disappointing for choices that you meet .
secondly , what economists call opperation costs .
dan gilbert did a big point this morning by telling how much the way we rate things about what we compare it to .
well , if there &apos;s a lot of alternatives to remember , it &apos;s just attractive properties of alternatives that contain them , that makes them less happiness with the alternatives that they chose .
here &apos;s an example . for those of you who are not new yorkers , i apologize .
but here &apos;s what they should have thought .
here &apos;s a couple on the hamptons .
very expensive .
beautiful beach . great day . you &apos;ve got it all for yourself .
what could be better ? &quot; damn the man thinks , &quot; it &apos;s august .
everybody in my manifest neighborhood is gone .
i could park right before my house . &quot;
and he &apos;s spending two weeks of the thought that he missed the opportunity , day over day to have a great parking .
opposition costs are the happiness that we get through our choices even when what we chose is fantastic .
and the more possibilities there are choices , the more attractive properties of these choices are considered in the opposition cost .
here &apos;s another example .
well , this cartoon makes some signs .
he &apos;s making a statement about it now , and maybe also doing things about it .
but one more important point he makes : always , if you decide for one thing , don &apos;t decide to do other things .
and these other things may have many attractive properties , and it &apos;s going to do what they &apos;re going to do less .
third , computation of expectations .
so this struck me when i wanted to exchange my jeans .
i wear jeans almost all the time .
and there was a time in which there was only jeans of a way , and they bought them , and they missed badly , they were incredibly domestic , and if they took them for long enough and they were getting enough , they started
so to buy new jeans after many years of the age of the old , and i said , &quot; i &apos;d like some jeans , here &apos;s my size . &quot;
and the salesman said , &quot; do you want to ski , easily beat or wide ?
do you want to clean buttons or crops ? stock or clean acid ?
do you want holes with holes ?
you &apos;d like to cut down far , bell , blah , blah blah blah ... &quot; and so on .
my jaw was down , and after i recovered , i said , &quot; i &apos;d like to have the way that was the only way . &quot;
he had no idea what that was , so i spent an hour trying to try all these damn jeans , and go to the business -- and i say the truth -- with the best advertising jeans i &apos;ve ever had .
i had better . all this choice allowed me to have better .
but i felt worse .
why ? i wrote a whole book to try to explain it to myself .
the reason that i felt bad , with all these available possibilities , my expectations for what makes a good couple of jeans , went up .
i had very low expectations . i had no specific expectations than they were in a way .
when they were in 100 species , damn it , one of them would have been perfect .
and what i got was good , but it wasn &apos;t perfect .
and so i missed what i was going to get to what i expected , and what i had was disappointing compared to what i expected .
adding possibilities in people &apos;s lives are inevitably increased the expectations people have about how good these possibilities are going to be .
and this leads to less happiness with the results , even though the results are good .
no one in the world of marketing knows this . because if you would , you all didn &apos;t know what was going on .
the truth is more like this .
the reason that used to be everything better than anything worse was when everything was worse , it was possible for people to make a pleasant surprise .
today , in the world that we live in -- we wealthy , industrialized citizens , with perfection as an expectation -- the best for you to ever hope is things as good as you expect them to happen .
they &apos;re never going to be annoyed , because their expectations , my expectations , are home .
the secret to happiness -- that &apos;s what you &apos;ve all come to -- the secret to happiness is low expectations .
i want to say -- a short autobiographical moment -- that i &apos;m married with a woman , and she &apos;s really wonderful .
i couldn &apos;t have done it better . i didn &apos;t leave myself .
but left is not always a bad thing .
finally , a consequence of the buy of a bad seat of jeans , if there &apos;s only one way to buy , that if you &apos;re unhappy , and you wonder why who is responsible , the world is responsible . the world is responsible .
if hundreds of different types of jeans are available , and they &apos;re buying one of the disappointments , and they ask why , who is responsible ?
it &apos;s also clear that the answer is to the question : she &apos;s .
they could have done better .
with 100 different types of jeans , there &apos;s no excuse for errors .
and so when people make decisions , and also when the results of decisions are good , they feel disappointed about it , they accumulate themselves .
clinical depression exploded in the industrial world in the last generation .
i don &apos;t think a significant one -- not the only one , but a significant contributor to this explosion of depression , and also suicide , is that people have experienced the disappointments because their standards are so high , and then
and so the commodity is that it &apos;s generally better , objective , and we feel worse .
so let me remind you .
this is the official dogma , which is one that we all think is right , completely wrong . it &apos;s not true .
there &apos;s no question that &apos;s better than not , but it doesn &apos;t follow more choices than a choice .
there &apos;s a magical amount . i don &apos;t know what it is .
i &apos;m pretty sure that we missed this point long for choice to improve our public health .
now , as a basic rule -- i &apos;m almost done -- as a reason , the thing about thinking is , what all this choice enables in industrialized societies is the material .
there are many places in the world , and we &apos;ve heard of many of them whose problem is not too big .
their problem is they have too little .
so the things i &apos;m talking about are a curious problem of modern , rich , western societies .
and what is so frustrating and angry : steve levffer has told you yesterday about how this expensive and hard car seat can &apos;t help them . it &apos;s a waste of money .
what i &apos;m telling you is that these expensive , complicated decisions -- it &apos;s not easy that they don &apos;t help .
they even hurt .
they worry that we are worse there .
if something of what makes people make decisions of our society to make decisions to the societies where people would have a little bit of choice , wouldn &apos;t only improve people &apos;s lives , but we would also improve our dignity .
economists call this a pure improvement .
income income is going to make it make everybody better -- not just the poor -- because all of this big choice is packed with us .
finally , read this cartoon , and , advanced person , say , &quot; ah ! what does this fish know ?
you don &apos;t know anything in this gulf glass . &quot;
preferred imagination , a short-term view of the world -- and that &apos;s the way i read it first .
but the more i thought about it , the more i &apos;ve come to see that fish knows something .
because the truth is that if you broke the gulf glass , so that everything is possible , you don &apos;t have freedom . you have paralysis .
if you broke the gulf glass so that everything is possible , you reduce happiness .
they increase paralysis and reduce happiness .
everyone needs a gold fish .
this is almost limited to complete security -- possibly for fish , definitely for us .
but it &apos;s taken by a metaphor of metaphorically , and it &apos;s a recipe for misery , and i suspect , disaster .
thank you very much .
you know , i &apos;ve talked about some of these projects earlier about the human genome and what that might mean , and the discovery of new groups of genes .
in fact , we start from a new point : we &apos;ve digitized biology , and now we &apos;re trying to get from digital code into a new phase of biology by designing new life and building new lives .
we always tried to ask meaningful questions .
what is life ? it &apos;s something i think many biologists have tried to understand , and that &apos;s on different levels .
we &apos;ve tried different approaches to simplify it to the minimum components .
we digitized for nearly 20 years . when we sequenced the human genome , the shift of the analytical world of biology was the digital world of the computer .
now , let &apos;s try to regenerate whether we can regenerate life , or can we make new life from this digital universe ?
this is the map of a small organism , mycoplasma griday , which has the smallest genome of a species that can replicate themselves in the lab , and we &apos;ve tried to do that with a smaller genome .
we &apos;ve done it on about a hundred genes that are about 500 or so on here .
but if we look at this metabolic map , which is very simple , compared to our . trust me , that &apos;s simple . but if we look at all of these genes that we can eliminate one after another , it &apos;s very unlikely
so we decided that it &apos;s the only way to synthesize this chromosome what allows us to vari the individual components and ask some of these fundamental questions .
and so we started asking the question , can we synthesize a chromosome ?
do you enable the chemistry to make these really big molecules that have never been done before ?
and if we can do that , can we start the chromosome ?
a chromosome is just a piece of inert chemical material .
our steps at the digital of life were exponentially .
so , our ability to write genetic code has been evolving very slowly , but the last thing we would do is put an exponential curve on an exponential curve .
15 years ago we started .
it took a couple of years to actually start with a bioethical review before we made the first experiments .
it turns out that dna synthesization is very difficult .
there are tens of thousands of machines around the world that can make little pieces of dna , 30 to 50 letters long , but it &apos;s a regenerative process , which is the longer you do a piece of errors that happen more mistakes .
so we had to develop a new method that we put together these little pieces and we could correct the errors .
this was our first attempt , starting with the digital information , the genome phi x 174 .
it &apos;s killing a little virus of bacteria .
we built little pieces , made a error reference and had a dna molecule of about 5,000 letters .
the exciting stage came when we took this piece of input chemical and gave it into a bacterium , and the bacteria started reading the genetic code and made viral particles .
the viral particles were then released from the cells and came back and killing e. coli .
recently , i talked to the oil industry , and they said they were going to understand this model .
they laugh more than they did here .
so we think that this is a situation in the software actually building its own hardware in a biological system .
but we wanted to go much further . we wanted to build an entire bacterial chromosome , and it has more than 580,000 letters genetic code , so we thought we &apos;re building it in bunks from the size of the virus , to
design is the key , and if you want to start with digital information in the computer , this digital information must be really miserable .
when we sequenced the genome first 1995 , the failure was a mistake of 10,000 base pairs .
we found 30 mistakes . if we used the original sequence , it would never have been possible to go up .
and part of the design is to make pieces that are the 50 letters long and have to overlap with other 50 letters , to build smaller sub-saharan so that they put together .
we &apos;ve built unique elements here .
you may have heard that we &apos;ve built charts .
think about it : we have a 4-digit code : a , c , g and t.
so , trillions of these letters -- these letters are about 20 amino acids , and there &apos;s a single purpose for each of these amino acids .
so we can use the genetic code to write our words , sentences , thoughts .
we just started signed .
some people were disappointed it wasn &apos;t a poetry .
we &apos;ve designed the pieces so that we could just deliver them with enzymes . there are enzymes that repair them and put together again .
and we started making pieces , starting with pieces that took five to seven thousand letters , adding these together around 24,000 letters to bring these back together , up to 72,000 .
in each case , we produced these pieces in the transit so that we could sequence them because we tried to create a very robust process what they &apos;re going to see in one minute .
we tried to get to the point of the car .
so , this looks like a baseball playforce .
if we get to these really big pieces -- with over 100,000 base pairs -- they &apos;re not just growing in e. coli , and it exceeds all the possibilities of modern molecular biology , and that &apos;s how we used other mechanisms .
we knew about a mechanism of the homolocation recommendation that uses biology to repair dna that can assemble these pieces .
here &apos;s an example of this . there &apos;s an organism called the documentary radio quarter of the three million wheel of radiation .
you see in the upper field that his chromosome is just falling apart .
12 to 24 hours later , everything used to combine as it was .
we have thousands of organisms that can do this .
these organisms can be completely dry , they can even live in the vacuum .
i &apos;m absolutely sure life exists in space and can move , looking for aquatic conditions .
in fact , nasa has shown that there &apos;s a lot out there .
here &apos;s a file of the molecule that we &apos;ve made by using these processes -- actually , we &apos;ve used fire mechanisms with the right design of the pieces , and so they &apos;re automatically adding them together .
this is not an electronic microscope . it &apos;s a regular microscope .
it &apos;s such a molecule that we can even see it with the light microscope .
these are recorded exceptions over six seconds .
this is the publication that we &apos;ve just done recently .
this is over 580,000 letters on genetic code . it &apos;s the biggest molecule that has ever been created by people .
it has over 300 million molecular weight .
if we print it with a writer of 10 and without absorbing , it would contain 142 pages just to print this genetic code .
now , how do we start a chromosome ? how do we activate it ?
obviously , with a virus , it &apos;s very simple with a virus . it &apos;s much more complicated with bacteria .
it &apos;s as simple as you &apos;re in ecarytes as we &apos;re doing it : you just take the nuclear out and you put another in there , and that &apos;s exactly what you &apos;ve all heard about the cloning .
in archaeologist , the chromosome is integrated in the cell , but just recently we &apos;ve shown that you can take a full transplant of a chromosome from one cell to another and can activate them .
and so , we put the chromosome of a microbial species . grab said , are those two as far as human beings and mice . we gave some extra extra genes to this so that we could select this chromosome , and
the new chromosome went to the cell .
in fact , we thought this is the end , but we tried to get the process a little bit further .
this is the main mechanism of evolution here .
we find all kinds of species here that have taken a second chromosome or a third of something , every time thousands of characteristics in only one second to a species .
so people who think evolution as a gene has changed a lot at a time has missed a lot of biology .
there are enzymes called the restaurants that actually digest dna .
the chromosome that was in the cell is not ; the chromosomes that we &apos;ve added .
it was expressed in the cell , and it recognized the other chromosome as a foreign material , and so we just had a cell with a new chromosome .
it displaced blue because of the genes that we &apos;ve added .
and after a very short time , it had lost all the characteristics of the species and completely confronted in a new species based on the new software that we &apos;ve given to the cell .
all the proteins changed the membrane -- when we read the genetic code , it was exactly what we &apos;ve translated .
it may sound like genome algorithms , but we can do that by changing software dna pretty dramatically .
now i &apos;ve argued that this is not the genius -- it &apos;s based on 3.5 billion years of evolution .
and i have argued that we may be able to create a new form of the camera explosion in which there could be massive new types of education based on this digital design .
why should we do that ?
i think it &apos;s pretty obvious to see what we need .
we grew up with six and a half billion people over the next 40 years .
to put it in my context , i was born in 1946 .
today , three people on this planet have existed for each one of 1946 ; within 40 years , it will be four .
we have problems with food , with fresh water , clean water , medicine , fuel for 6.5 billion people .
it will offer a challenge to nine .
we need over five billion tons of coal , 30 plus billion flow oil . that &apos;s 100 million miles a day .
if we think about biological processes , or any process to replace this , it becomes a huge challenge .
then , of course , there &apos;s all the co2 from this material that landed in the atmosphere .
we have now from our discoveries from all over the world , a database with about 20 million genes , and i want to believe that these are the world &apos;s world rights rights .
the electronic industry had a dozen components , and look at the diversity that came out of it .
so we &apos;re in the first line here to the limits of biological reality and that of our imagination .
we have technology today because of this fast synthesis of this rapid synthesis to do what we call combinary genetics .
we now have the ability to build a big robot that can make millions of chromosomes a day .
if you imagine these 20 million different genes , or optimize these processes to make ok , or drugs new vaccines , we can change more molecular biology than the last 20 years science .
and it &apos;s just selection . we can select for life ability , production of chemicals or fuel production and so on .
this is a picture of actual design software that we work with , which you actually sit in and design new species on the computer .
you know , we don &apos;t necessarily know what it &apos;s going to look like . we know exactly what the genetic code is going to look like .
now we &apos;re focusing on the fourth generation of the fourth generation .
you &apos;ve seen corn ethanol recently , which is a bad experiment .
we have the second generation of the second generation and third generation that are going to come out relatively soon that will have much higher acceptance , like okapi or different kinds of branol .
but , as we think , the only way we think of biology is a huge impact without increasing food , or limitation of their availability , when we see co2 as a result , and that &apos;s why we &apos;re working on cells that go
and we think that we &apos;re going to be the first one with the fourth generation , and that &apos;s about 18 months .
sunlight and co2 are a method .
but in our discovery of the world , we all have different types of methods .
this is an organism that we described in 1996 .
he lives in the deep sea , about one and a half miles deep , near cooking water .
it changes co2 in methane by using hydrogen as a source of energy .
we see whether we can use stones of stored co2 , which could easily be brought to productivity , compare the co2 in the fuel to drive this process .
within a short time period , we think we could be able to solve one of the basic questions of life .
you know , we really -- modern goals like the substitute of all the poetry industry , right . if you can &apos;t do that at ted , where else ?
but that &apos;s the way we &apos;re working right now to put the same approaches to the development of vaccine .
you saw this this year with the flu , we &apos;re always a year behind it , and we have a dollar too little when it comes to the right vaccine .
i think this can be changed by creating recommended vaccines in front of us .
that &apos;s what the future might look like with change , can be accelerated today with synthetic bacteria , archaia , and perhaps ecarontes .
we &apos;re able to improve people &apos;s light years , and our goal is that we have a chance to survive for a long time to survive that . thank you very much .
on the last ted conference i gave an introduction to the lhc .
and i proved back to explain how the machine works .
so here it is . and for those of those who weren &apos;t there , the lhc is the largest scientific experiment that ever got -- 27 miles in diameter .
his job is to create the conditions that existed less than a billionth of a second after the beginning of the universe -- and to 600 million times within a second .
it &apos;s just breathtaking ambition .
this is the machine under geneva .
we take images of this mini nucleus in detectors .
this is what i work on . it &apos;s called atlas detector -- 44 meters in the width , 22 meters in diameter .
here &apos;s a spectacular picture of the atlas in the construction so that you see the scale of the scale .
on september 10th , the machine went on for the first time .
and this picture was taken by atlas .
it caused huge jbels in the control room .
it &apos;s a picture of the first rays of rays that put the lhc out to the lhc , and then clearly , with a part of the lhc , they colonized a rain of particles on the detector .
in other words , when we saw this picture on september 10 , we knew that the machine works , which is a big triumph .
i don &apos;t know if this was the biggest joke , or this when someone visited the google side and found the front page .
it means that we reached a cultural impact next to the science .
about a week later , there was a problem with the machine which had been doing these wires here -- these golden wires here .
these wires led 13-thousand amperates when the machine runs up on high performance .
now , the engineers among them will look and say , &quot; no , they don &apos;t . these are little wires . &quot;
you can afford that because if you cool them up very far , they become so called a discussion .
so at minus 271 degrees , colder than the room between stars , these wires can hold tension .
in one of the connections , between the nine thousand magnets in the lhc , there was a mountain square .
so the wires release a little and 13-thousand amals , suddenly , suddenly electrical resistance .
that was the result .
now , this is all impressive , if you imagine that the magnets are running over 20 tons and drops to about 30 inches .
so we damaged about 50 of the magnets .
and they had to remove what we did .
we copied them up , fixed them .
they &apos;re all back on their way back to their path .
on the end of march , the lhc will be again functional .
we &apos;re going to turn it off , and we &apos;ll be able to collect first data in june or july , and we continue our journey to figure out what the building blocks of the universe are .
well , of course , in a way that accidents relate to the value of science and engineering in such boundaries , it &apos;s easy to reject something like this .
i think it &apos;s so hard , the fact that we move beyond our borders is creating the value of things like the lhc .
i &apos;m going to leave my closest words to an english scientist . puzzy day , who , as i suspect , defended the useless experiments of his apprentice , his apprentice was michael paradigm , which said , &quot; nothing is
thank you .
i &apos;m a writer .
writing books is my job , but it &apos;s more than that .
it &apos;s also my big life long , lifelong love and fascination .
and i don &apos;t expect that to be changed .
however , kittens is a little bit weird in my life and my career , which has made me completely think about this work .
this curious event was that i &apos;ve recently written a book -- a biography called a fey &apos;s game , pray , love branch -- which , in fact , decided to be different from all my previous books for some reason in the world
the result is that , no matter where i come , i &apos;m going to be treated as if i was going to be treated .
seriously -- keep growing !
for example , they come up to me and say , &quot; don &apos;t you fear that you &apos;re never going to get over this success ?
don &apos;t you have a fear of writing your whole life and never create a book that is interested in anybody in the world ? never ?
okay , that really makes the courage .
but it would be worse if i didn &apos;t remind myself that i was about 20 years ago when i first told you that i wanted to be a writer with the same kind of feminist response .
people said , you don &apos;t have a fear of having any success ?
don &apos;t you fear you kill the humility of a request ?
don &apos;t you scare that you &apos;re going to take a long time off your life , and you &apos;re never going to come up with anything , and you &apos;re going to die on a shrimp of dreams -- your mouth filled with the bitter as
it &apos;s like , you know .
the answer -- the short answer to all of these questions is : yes .
yes , i &apos;m afraid of all of these things .
and i always had that .
and i fear a lot more things that nobody would release .
like algae -- and other frightening things .
but when i think about writing , i &apos;ve been thinking about it recently , and i ask myself , why ?
is that sensible ?
is it logical that somebody should be expected by that that he &apos;s afraid of doing the work that he feels .
and what &apos;s right with the creative entrepreneurs that they make us uncertain about the individual mental state -- in a way that other professions don &apos;t ?
my father , for example , was chemists , and i can &apos;t remember a situation in his 40 years as a chemist where he was asked if he was afraid to be chemists .
with your chemist holocaust , john -- how about that ?
it just didn &apos;t happen , you know ?
but to be fair -- the group of chemists , over the centuries , have not received the reputation of alcoo increasure people .
and we writer that kind of call , but not just the writers , but the creative all of the revenue , seems to have that reputation , to be mental imperative .
all you need to do is look at the bitter towers of really great heads alone from the 20th century , the young and often from their own hand .
and even the ones that didn &apos;t actually have really been extremely neglected by their talents seemed to be really neglected by their talents .
norman maerer said shortly before his death in his last interviewer : skill every one of my books was killed me a little bit further .
an extraordinary statement that you can do about your workplace .
but we don &apos;t even notice that if we hear someone like this , because we know this kind of statement for such a long time , we &apos;ve somehow accepted the perception of creativity and collectively that creativity and suffering , of course , will
the question i want to ask everybody here is , is this idea of all right ?
do you feel like that ? because at only one centimeter , it looks like -- i don &apos;t feel like that perception at all .
i think it &apos;s obvious .
and i think it &apos;s dangerous . and i don &apos;t want to watch it take over the next century .
i think it better when we live our great creative encouragement .
and i definitely know that it was for me -- in my situation -- very dangerous to start , to start in this dark path of the guess -- especially in the circumstance that i &apos;m in my career right now .
that means -- look : i &apos;m pretty young . i &apos;m only about 40 years old .
i may have another 40 work years .
and it &apos;s very likely that everything i &apos;m going to write from now from the world as the work that came after the high book of my last book , right ?
i &apos;m just saying it , because we &apos;re all kind of friends here -- it &apos;s very likely that my biggest success is behind me .
oh , jesus , what a thought !
that &apos;s the kind of thought that someone can get someone to start 9 a.m. in the morning , drink gin . and i don &apos;t want that .
i would rather rather do this work that i love .
so the question is : how ?
after some time of reflecting , i seem to be able to write more and more , and design a kind of protecting psychological construct .
so somehow , i have to find a way to true a safe distance between me and my very natural care about what the reaction is about to be written .
while i was looking for models in the last year to do that , i also looked at the past , and i &apos;ve tried to find other societies to see if they had had better or sensible ideas about it as we can help creative risk with
this search led me to the old greece and the old rome .
please follow me , because the circle will close again .
but in the old greece and rome people didn &apos;t believe that creativity comes from people , okay ?
they believed that creativity was a kind of divine servant mind that comes from a distant , unknown source to people -- from unexplained , unknown reasons .
the greeks called these divine servant spirals of creativity to demonstrate demons .
by socrates , he believed that he believed he had a thylacine that gave him wisdom from far away .
the romans had the same idea , called this kind of body creative mind , an unhealthy genius .
this is great . the romans didn &apos;t really think that a genius was a particularly smart individual .
they believed that a genius was this kind of magic divine creature , who believed that it was literally living in the walls of an artist -- about like dumbby , the pet pet , and the artist , and the artist at the work ,
this is brilliant -- there it is , there &apos;s the distance i talked about -- the psychological construct that protects you from the consequences of your work .
and everybody knew that it worked , right ?
the artist of aging was protected in particular things , like , for example , too narcissism , right ?
if your work was brilliant , you couldn &apos;t look at everything for you . everybody knew you had this body genius that helped you .
if your work flew -- not entirely your mistake , right ?
everybody knew their genius was a little bit lamey .
so the people in the west have been thinking about creativity quite a long time .
and then the renaissance and everything changed . we had this big idea . and that big idea was : let &apos;s put the human individual into the center of the universe -- all the gods and mysteries , and there &apos;s no room for
it &apos;s the beginning of rational humanism , and people started to believe that creativity was completely from their individual .
for the first time in history , you hear people call it a genius -- instead of having a genius .
i have to tell you , i think that was a big mistake .
you know ? i think you allow a blog person to allow him to think he or she &apos;s like the coke and the essence and the source of all the divine , creative , unfair mystery , a little bit too much responsibility to
it &apos;s like asking someone to swallow the sun .
that makes and disturbing all of the egos , and it creates all these unable expectations to success .
i think that success press has destroyed our artists for the last 500 years .
and if that &apos;s true , and i think it &apos;s true -- is the question .
can we change it ?
maybe an old-fashioned understanding about the relationship between people and the mystery of creative return .
maybe not .
maybe we can &apos;t just expose the idea of 500 years rational humanism in a 18-year-old talk .
and there &apos;s certainly people in this audience who would really report the world &apos;s really latest doubts about the notion of -- basically -- features that follow people and apply feminia to their projects and so on .
i &apos;m probably not going to take all of you on this journey .
but the question i want to throw up is : why not ?
why not think about it ?
because it makes as much sense as anything that i heard about when it went to explain the absolutely crazy domain of the creative process .
a process that has -- like everyone knows that has ever tried to make something -- so in other words , everybody here -- not always reasonable .
indeed , it can sometimes feel paranys .
i had recently met such an encounter when i met the extraordinary american poet stone , which is now over 90 , but it was all his life for poet , and she told me that when she was growing up in the villages of
she said it would be like a thread train out of air .
that would cause them to beat on the land .
she felt when it came because it would bring the earth under their feet .
she knew that she could only do one such moment , and that was -- in their words -- scarce race like the devil .
they ran like the devil to the house while they were tracking from this poem , and it was only that they had to get fast enough to a sheet of paper and a pen so that if it could go through them , they could
at other times , she wasn &apos;t fast enough . they ran and ran and ran , but she didn &apos;t get the house , and the poem was rotating through them , and she missed it . she said it would continue on land , and
and then there were these moments -- the part i &apos;m never going to forget -- she said there were moments in which she almost missed it .
so , she &apos;s running to the house , and she &apos;s looking for paper , and the poem goes through her and she takes a pen just when she goes through her and then -- she said -- it was as if her other hand is going
she caught the poem on his tail , and she pulled it back into her body and took it on the piece of paper .
in these opportunities , the poem came out and intact on paper -- but backwards -- from the last word to the first .
and when i heard that , i thought that was uncommon -- that &apos;s just like my creative process .
it &apos;s not like my creative process -- i &apos;m not the channel !
i &apos;m a mail . to work on , i have to stand up at the same time every day and sweat , tick up and get really unpleasant .
but even in my mirror art , sometimes i did this thing .
and i guess many of you have done that too .
even i had work or ideas that came out of a source through me that i can &apos;t really identify .
what is that one thing ?
and how do we deal with it without losing our mind , but keeping ourselves in the contrary of mental health ?
for me , the best living example is how to create this musician tom surfaces , and i allowed him to interview a magazine a few years ago .
we talked about this issue . and you know what ? most of his life was tom the embodiment of modern modern artists trying to take these uncontrolled creative pulses in him , and to get to work with them .
but then he got older and quiet . he told me that one day he dropped on a fastroad in los angeles , and then everything changed for him .
he was driving with high speed as he suddenly hears a little fragment of a melody , which is a lot easier for him to be prepared for him , and he wants to have them . she &apos;s very fabulous . he
he doesn &apos;t have a piece of paper ; he doesn &apos;t have a pencil ; he doesn &apos;t have a cubicle .
so he starts up , this old array of arithmetic , like i &apos;m going to lose this thing , and will be tracked by this song forever .
i &apos;m not good enough ; i won &apos;t do it . &quot;
but instead of getting into panic , he just stopped .
he finished the whole thought and did something completely new .
and he just looked in the sky , and he said , &quot; i &apos;m sorry , can you see that i drive car ? &quot;
what do i look like i &apos;m writing a song ?
if you really want to exist , come back to a cheap moment when i can take care of you .
if not , quantity today .
go and quonle leonard cohen .
his whole work process has changed .
not the work itself . it was still as dark as ever ever .
but the process and the severe care that surrounded him was up when he took the genius out of the field where he got out of trouble and went back to where he came from , and he realized that it had to be an internal
it could give a self-assembling , wonderful , bizarre collaboration , a kind of conversation between tom and the most exciting , analytical thing that wasn &apos;t very tom .
when i heard this story , it also changed a little bit of the way i worked , and i &apos;ve ever saved it once .
so this idea saved me when i was in the middle of the design process , pray , love , love , and i went into one of these scanning of the doubts that we all fall out of , and it doesn &apos;t work .
not just bad , but the worst of all times .
i started thinking , i should just package the project .
but then i reminded how tom had talked to the free sky , and i tried .
so i &apos;d like to look at the manuscript , and i talked about my comment towards a empty corner of the room .
i talked loudly , you listen , you , you and i know both , if this book is not brilliant , it &apos;s not entirely my fault , right ?
because you see , i &apos;m investing on all the things i have , i don &apos;t have any more than that .
so if you want to get it better , you have to cross here and hold your percentage .
okay . but if you don &apos;t do that -- you know what , then the devil .
i &apos;m still going to write , because that &apos;s my job .
and i want to give you a question of that i was here today for my part of the jobs .
because ... at the end of it it &apos;s like the following . centuries ago , in the desert of north africa , there are people in the desert of north africa that were collected with sacred dins and music for hours -- until dawn .
these tides always were great because the dancers were professional , and they were fantastic .
but again , very rarely , something special happened . one of the editors was actually overwhelmed .
and i know you know what i mean , because i know you &apos;ve all seen such a performance in your life .
it was just as if the dancer stands up in a kind of location , and he didn &apos;t do anything different than he ever did before -- 1,000 nights before , but everything got together .
and all of a sudden , he no longer seemed to be human .
he was driven by inside and fired down from the inside , and everything went through a divine fire .
as something happened at the time , people knew what that was . they called it in his name .
they put the hands together , and they started singing : clouds of allah , allah , allah , god , god , god . &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ;
this is god , you know ?
interesting historical footnote : when the murderers brought out south scanner , they had changed this need , and the language was changing over the centuries of the centuries of non-zero-sum allah , allah , allah bike , to be
if a performer in spain has a little bit impossible , something magical : pure allah , ofe , ofe , allah , great , bravo , bravo , that is a very powerful look at god .
and that &apos;s great because we need that .
but , the tricky part is following the next morning when the dancer himself wakes up and realizes that 11 o &apos;clock is on a tuesday -- and he no longer wears a stick of god .
he &apos;s only an older dying with painful knees , and maybe he &apos;s never going to get up to those altitudes again .
and maybe someone &apos;s never going to call god &apos;s name when he &apos;s rotating , but what would he do with the rest of his life ?
that &apos;s hard .
this is one of the most painful corretions of a creative life .
but maybe it doesn &apos;t have to be so full of pig , if you didn &apos;t believe from the beginning , that the most extraordinary aspects of your existence are coming from you .
if you may just believe that you &apos;re a gift -- from an unprecedented source for a walkable time of your life that &apos;s passed on to someone else when you &apos;re done with it .
when we start thinking about this , it changes everything .
so i started thinking , and so i think with safety in the past months , while i was working on the book that &apos;s going to appear soon -- as the dangerous , scary , very expected successor to my own success .
what i have to say constantly , when i &apos;m crazy about it , is not afraid .
it &apos;s not encouraging .
make your job just your job .
it &apos;s still for your contribution to whatever he wants to be .
if your job is dancing , dance .
if the stupid divine genius that you put on the page for a very short moment is to show a hall of miracle with your effort , the olympic olymp !
and if not , dance even though your dance .
and oyster oyster ! former for you , despite all of those .
i believe in that and i feel that we should teach this .
unconditional olympic oyster ! for you , despite all of this , just for you to be the mechanistic human love and your own purpose to be there .
thank you .
thank you .
ooh !
last year , i showed these two slides to illustrate that the arctic ice chain , which had been the size of the lower 48 states , has shredded the size of the lower 48 states .
but this is not enough enough to push the seriousness of this particular problem because it doesn &apos;t show the thickness of the ice .
in a sense , the arctic ice box is the beating heart of our global clinic system .
it grows in the winter and swollen in the summer .
the next slide i &apos;m going to show you is a time-lapse of what happened over the last 25 years .
the duration is branded with red .
as you can see , it grows on the dark . this is the annual ice in winter ; and it shrinks in summer .
the so-called duration , five years old or older , is almost like blood that &apos;s coming out of the body here .
25 years , it &apos;s going to be gone from here .
this is a problem because warming is the frozen reason around the arctic ocean , where there &apos;s large amounts of frozen carbon , which when it comes up from microbes to methane .
compared to the whole amount of climate change in the atmosphere , that contract could double when we cross this critical point .
already today , in some flat lakes in alaska methane from itself out of the water .
professor ky walter at the university of alaska traveled to another program of the last winter lake .
wow !
it &apos;s good . the question is , how will it go .
and one reason is that this enormous heat heat warms greenland from the north .
this is an annual river river .
but the volumes are much bigger than ever before .
this is the kuriuan river river in southwest greenland .
if you want to know how sea level is going through land pollution , it &apos;s heating it into the sea .
these rivers take rapid .
on the other end of the planet , antarctica , the largest ice mass on the planet .
for the last month , researchers said that the entire continent has now a negative ice package .
and the west aristocracy , which is divided across a few underwater islands is particularly powerful in melting .
this is 20 feet of sea level , like greenland .
in the himalayas , the third largest ice mass , you see new lakes on the top there , glaciers were glaciers a couple of years ago .
40 percent of all the people around the world get half of their drinking water from this melting water .
this glacier is the drinking water for this city .
the water amounts have expanded .
but when they unite , most of the drinking water is going to fall away .
in california , a 40 percent reduction in the slight of sierra was seen .
this is the memory of memory .
and the predictions of how you read them are serious .
this authority throughout the world leads to a dramatic increase in fire .
and the disasters all over the world have increased in a really extraordinary and pregnant scale .
four times in the last 30 years , like in the previous 75 .
this is an entirely unsustainable process pattern .
if you look at this in historical context , you can see what it does .
over the last five years , we &apos;ve produced 70 million tons of co2 every 24 hours -- 25 million tons every day .
look at the area of eastern pacific , from american continent western , and after the indian subtle , where there &apos;s a dramatic decline of oxygen in the oceans .
the biggest single factor for global warming , by deforestation , which is 20 percent , is burning by fossil fuels .
oil is a problem , and coal is the most important problem .
the united states is one of the two major conservation workers , together with china .
and the proposal was to build many more coalfactories .
but we start to see a change .
here are those who have been dropped out of the last few years with some green alternatives that were proposed .
in the mean , there &apos;s a political disorder in our country .
and the coolest budgets and oil industries have spent a quarter of a dollar last kitchen year to address clean coal , which is a contradiction in itself .
and this picture reminded me of something .
for christmas around christmas , at me at home in tennessee , a billion tons of hybrids .
you &apos;ve probably seen the news in the news .
this is the second largest waste of america in our entire country .
this happened about christmas .
and one of the ads of the cocaine industry about christmas was this .
frostity of coalman is an intelligent , happy burst .
it &apos;s in skin and fibers in america , and it helps to grow our economy .
froststy , the coalman gets cleaner every day .
it &apos;s affordable and lovely , and workers stay in wage and bread .
this is the source of most coal in west virginia .
the most powerful consistent is the leader of massy coal .
let me tell you a very clearly . al gore , nancy peg , harry ridge , they don &apos;t know what they &apos;re talking about .
so the alliance for climate protection has created two campaigns .
this is one , part of her .
in the comfort , we see climate change as a serious danger for our business .
so we set it up for the supreme scale , to spend a significant money , to bring a handle on the way to the truth of coal .
in fact , coal is not dirty .
we think it &apos;s clean -- and it &apos;s also smelling good .
so , don &apos;t worry about climate change .
let &apos;s leave that to us .
sacred coal , you &apos;ve heard a lot about it .
so let &apos;s make a tour of this modern , clean coal factory .
fantastic ! this machine is quite loud .
but it &apos;s the sound of clean coal technology .
and yet the burn of coal is one of the main warming for global warming , the remarkable clean coal technology that you see here , changes everything .
so look at it right now , this is today &apos;s clean coal technology .
finally , the positive alternative with our economic challenge and our challenge of national security .
america is in a crisis , economics , national security , the climate crisis .
the red guy that connects all of these is our dependence on carbon to boost power fuel like dirty coal and foreign oil .
but now there &apos;s a courageous , new solution to keep us out of this miserable situation .
the next 10 percent clean electricity remains clean electricity in the next 10 years .
a plan to get america back to work to make us safer and help stop global warming .
finally , a solution that is big enough to solve our problems .
worry about america . find out more .
this is the last .
it &apos;s about the food supply of america .
one of the fastest ways of reducing our dependence on old , dirty fuels that stack our world .
the future is here . wind , sun and a new energy system .
new investments to create good paid jobs .
worry about america . it &apos;s time to accept reality .
there &apos;s an old african saying : &quot; if you want to be fast , go alone .
if you want to come far , go together . &quot;
we need to get far , fast .
thank you .
i want to start asking you to rethink back to the time of their childhood when they were playing with contradictions .
while they realized how to get their hands out and access their hands , pick up the calculations and move them , they actually learned to think and change problems through understanding and changing space .
spatial thinking is deeply connected to how we understand most of our environment .
as a computer scientist -- inspired by the kind of interaction with real objects -- with my presidential patti and my colleagues at sanan kahinua , i started wondering : what if we would use computers , which is moving like a digital show on
this question was so profound that we decided to study the answer , and we developed silk .
in short , a football is an interactive computer in the size of a keg .
you can move with your hand , you can see each other , you can see their movements , and they have a screen and a spray .
much more important : are physically why you can only move them like building blocks through the outreach of hands and access .
and the silk ones are an example of a new generation of tools to manipulate digital data .
and if these tools are going to become more physical and develop a conscious mind for their movements , see each other and see the subjects of our deals with them , we can start with exploring new and entertaining interactions .
i start with some simple examples .
this seal is concentrated for the video procedure , and when i put it in a direction of kilo , the video will play forward , when i go to the other door , it goes backwards .
and these interactive portraits are true to each other .
so if i put them side-by-side , it makes you interested .
if you &apos;re vocabulary , you &apos;ll notice that , and you can get a little nervous .
and they feel their movements as well , and slowing down .
so , an interesting sequence of interactions that we started to realize was that we could apply everyday gestures on data , like color so shifted , how to do this with liquids .
in this case , we &apos;ve concentrated three silk cells as a farmer , and i can use them to chase color in the middle , where they &apos;re mixed up .
if we push it , we can relate a little bit .
there &apos;s also some nice possibilities in education like languages , mathematics or logic , where we give people the opportunity of fast error and see the results immediately .
here i am -- this is a fibonacci series that i &apos;m drawing with a simple equation program .
this is a game with words , which is kind of mixture of the schedule and buggling .
basically , every round on every one of the cambridge happens to be depressed , and while you &apos;re trying to form words , they &apos;re tested by a dictionary .
then , after about 30 seconds , again , mixed up and you have a new letter combination and new possibilities .
thank you .
these are some kids who came up to the media lab , and i could move them to try and take a video of it .
you really loved it .
one more interesting thing about this kind of application is that you don &apos;t have to give people a lot of instructions .
all you have to say is form words , and you know exactly what to do .
here &apos;s another couple of people testing it .
this is our youngest beta-tester down there .
it turned out that he wanted to stack the boxes .
so for him , they were just building blocks .
this is an interactive trickster .
we wanted to develop a study of controls .
this is practical .
he can bring new characters into the scene by blowing the football from the table that shows this character .
here he &apos;s going the sun up .
the sun goes on .
now he takes a tractor in the scene .
the orange tractor .
good work ! yeah !
by shaking the football and putting them side-by-side , it can interact with the characters .
... his own story , invent .
hello !
it &apos;s a story with open end , and it can decide how it evolved .
flying cat .
the last example i have today , to show it , is a music secretary for live spaces that we &apos;ve recently developed , and in the football as a sound , how leadership , bass and taxes .
each has four different variations ; you can choose what you want to use .
and you can tap these sounds into the sequence that you can turn in again in popular patterns .
and you turn them in by holding a ton of sound on a sequence of the sequence .
there are effects that you can change live like hall and filter .
you connect him with a certain sound and then you put it in place .
and then more controlled effects like speed and volume that you apply to the entire sequence .
so let &apos;s see .
we start in which we air the leadership in two sequence of silk marbles and put them in a row , expand and add a little bit more of the voice .
now i add a bass .
now i &apos;m going to do some more dramatically .
and now i plug the filter with the beaten so that i can drive the effect live .
i can speed up the whole sequence by putting the speed in one direction or another .
and now i plug the filter with the bass , for something more expression .
i can make the sequence while she &apos;s running .
and so i don &apos;t have to put them in the front of the field , but can improvise ; they can extend or cut over .
and finally , i can extend the whole sequence by negotiating the hydrophobic on the left .
thank you .
so as you can see , my desire is to develop new human computer interface , which is better to fit the way our brains and bodies work .
and today , i had time to show you a part of this new design world and some of the possibilities of what we work on in our lab .
the idea that i want to give you to you is that we stand on the threshold of this new generation of applications to the digital media , which bring information into our world that is in our demands .
thank you .
i &apos;m happy to talk to you all !
yeah , good afternoon .
i &apos;m happy i &apos;m there .
yeah , so what should be bihoking ?
i just have to pick it up a little bit , and bhoking is busy with modern molecular biology .
i &apos;ve been studying molecular biology , and i &apos;ve been working with the bipedant for a couple of years , and that &apos;s what i started with , because i just wanted to know about it , and i wanted to do it in the study
so , that was my primary motivation .
so it was a curiosity , and i wanted to sort of get closer to matter , like that .
i think molecular biology in general now talked about the general , biotechnology , everything that you count to synthetic biology and so on .
what &apos;s important is now extremely important , and yet much , much more important is going to become in the future .
there are so controlled things like all these genetically engineered plants on the wall .
now there &apos;s craig venter in the u.s. , trying to make biofuel , so gas from algae .
so below that , there &apos;s also something that &apos;s totally gone on in the daily day , which most people are not aware of , for example , for example , for example , the memories that allow us to do with four degrees of laundry
and the list can continue to continue .
and so , from the interest of this technology , i just continued to go on .
which is why hacking now ?
most people know this from the software system .
computers hack , and then in the media , it will always happen in the media , yes , the hackers break somewhere and claws data and so on .
it &apos;s kind of sad for the hackers , because that &apos;s not what they actually started to do , and what &apos;s actually going on there .
and that &apos;s what the software hackers are starting to do in the &apos; 70s , &apos; 80s with computer bases , and it &apos;s also created the internet .
and it &apos;s about solving a playful , creative , original way to solve a problem .
and problem , that &apos;s not just a technical problem , it can also be a social problem , it can also be an access of access , which is just like things simplified , so a problem of problem , and how can you make a question
and it &apos;s been done with software , but it &apos;s also in the electronic area , and there &apos;s a whole bacterium that does all sorts of abundant things .
and now we &apos;re going towards biology , and i want this metaphor that &apos;s coming from synthetic biology , that biology is actually a information science , because the d.ne. code is a abstract code , which is , it &apos;s not just like
but it &apos;s also a code , and you can also program that and you can also write it in hackers , like this , and that &apos;s what i found incredibly fascinating , and i just wanted to get much deeper with it .
this actually took only a second thousand eight , these networks .
there &apos;s a hacking dot organ , which is originally from switzerland , which is with europe and with cooperation in india , but now members or active people have all over the world .
this is a more artistic exercise , so there &apos;s a lot of artists and philosophers and collaboration with scientists with these technologies to take care of them and ask questions and do the creative thing , because there are museums and yes
but it &apos;s always about finding such a slow access , such a playful thing to do with it .
and then there &apos;s do-it-individual dotted organ or d.i.
this is a network of the u.n. system , which is actually more like a form of forum where you &apos;re concerned and talking online .
they &apos;re a little more technical , and they &apos;re also a little bit of business , and they &apos;re also going to ask questions like that .
and from these networks that have done the whole popular , it &apos;s a scene that i just want to have portraits .
here in the image on the left you see biocuriousus , this is a hamburger , basically a kind of school , such a private school , nonprofit corporation , where everyone can come .
children , old , all kinds of people , are going to go to it , and they put a laboratory in the lab and look at what you can do when these lab proportions .
here on the left is a group in indonesia , house from indonesia , which is called the one , which is quite a long time .
even than those other two networks .
they also act in such an artistic aspect of biological materials and , yes , electronics , and combine it in quite a working way .
a group of beara that i &apos;ve met for a while ago , which is a student of students who would want to convey the public more than what they learn in college , and they &apos;ve done so on long-term small actions and try to
and i put a lecture up in copenhagen at the medical museum in combination with an exhibition on the topic .
and this is , yes , that &apos;s quite young people , but the only thing that is united of what &apos;s all united , is this fascination of technology .
and what you can do with it and you can also get the society to deal with it and ask , like , okay , what do you want , what do you want to do with it , have your interest in bringing you to this ?
so , o.k. to hack biology now , you kind of need materials .
you need biological materials , of course , and you need tools also , and that &apos;s a lab .
what you usually understand under a lab , which is kind of abundant machines , extremely expensive , extremely distant , only for professional , trained academics , and so on .
and our approach was just to say , okay , you don &apos;t have to do that .
it &apos;s actually not necessary , because every single coffee machine has actually more developed technology than most of the labs , which is really like that .
and in this premise with this premise with this premise , for example , brian deckger in england is trying to put a minimum absorb , and then took an underground conviction , a hot plate , and , yes
so every one that &apos;s been complaining about a soup that he &apos;s standing too long , it &apos;s even done .
and i tried this in my lab home a little bit , and then i was buying so secretary hand peers on ebay and made a little d.d. analysis , trying to do a father &apos;s father , such a d.c.
now this shouldn &apos;t be a joke .
in the middle of this picture , you see the lab , in the introduction , so a employeed garage is also so much possible with the united kingdom , a group in paris , which is determined , and pretty successfully ,
and this is biocuriousus , which is also called the hackacks , this one , kind of a volks of school , basically for molecular biology .
and yes , you see , it &apos;s relatively relative , so this is because of people who are doing it in their own , so far to great organizations , which are also going to do more for more former in institutional form .
but always the idea that it &apos;s supposed to be simple and accessible .
the first project that we &apos;ve done as an international group , when we became aware of ourselves , ok , now we &apos;re here as a real scene , and we are online , and we know these people that always have chatts and stuff .
and then it came from the do-it-individual george website website on the founder , and we &apos;ve got to really meet us now , also meet two events , one in london , one in london , and short to the u.s. , in san
and so , there it was , the o.k. , who are we , what do we want , what do we want to share ?
and what are our values and what are our goals , our foundations ?
and so we &apos;ve been working on a code of code .
that was quite intuitive , so everybody just has this wish , his and what &apos;s going to move it , then .
there was , i think , a very good code .
and then we have this is not compulsive , but that &apos;s just , i think , relatively good , and people are quite convinced about this .
and we actually tried to bring it back into the academic world , but it &apos;s kind of not that way .
so i think , in fact , we are from the bihove in terms of even one step further than the academic world .
yes , what kind of projects do we actually do ?
a project that i made with the hack network in switzerland itself was that we wanted to have a so-called optical trap or optical chain .
this is when you focus a laser , on one in the room , you can catch little particles in the air , or in the liquid and then move into this focus , so that &apos;s the one that &apos;s stuck there , which is like
it really works , it &apos;s made in the academic sets , and we thought , okay , we may have got a webcam , and then we took a webcam that cuts , turn around the lens , then you have a microscope
this is what you see down there .
and then we took a d.v. burn , and the bars go out the laser and then try to focus on this camera .
and that didn &apos;t work , but we &apos;ve learned a lot yet .
so another project that &apos;s from the french group there from paris , it &apos;s done , it &apos;s pretty cool .
and so , it &apos;s an example of this , like a brain wave , such e.g. , or something like that , so he &apos;s busy with neurrobiology , his nickname is sam new york .
and he &apos;s then broken this helmet there , and he was in cooperation with the museum .
and there could be visitors going into the room , sitting on this chair , putting this helmet up .
then their brainwaves were measured , and depending on what they thought , or how they thought , you &apos;ve got different lights in the room .
a pretty fancy project was quite a fate project .
another thing from the united states , which is also about to do with this father &apos;s face , is the p.c. , this is the polymer candidate , complicated word .
so it &apos;s about copying genes , breeding , disney , getting fragments to make them visible .
so , if i do this now , the profileers at the crime go , collect , collect any hair , and then they do this kind of method , and then they can say , o.k. , this hair belongs to this person
and the machines that do something like this are quite expensive that you buy commercial , the cheapest one goes away as a thousand euros .
and that &apos;s not at the hobbyfield , but it &apos;s a really cool technology that can also be a lot .
so this is just an application of many that you can do with it .
and they &apos;ve been doing so two two bags , and they said , well , we &apos;re doing simple and cheaper , and we have open source hardware , electronics , which are combined with this device , and now they &apos;ve actually
i think something like that six hundred dollars or something like that .
but anyway , it &apos;s still not cheap yet , but it &apos;s definitely in a framework where it &apos;s clearly becoming available .
so , i think it &apos;s a very rigid hack .
a project that i started to start with was to build a gene .
gene is , yes , like a light gun , which shoots about that far , two centimeters or something like that .
you invite d.ne. at the gold part and the gold part then , and then i shot it down on cash , and then you put them in the light and you put them in light .
so the device you see there , that didn &apos;t work .
but this is my prototype , but it &apos;s been pretty high-tech , so that kind of thing , the thing on , electronics and pressure closed , and that was the pressure , but that thing was broken .
and then i took a photophoto and closed that .
a photophoto , if you make the full power of water , has enough pressure , so i think it &apos;s so 40 to select bar .
and then you can speed up the particles strongly , and then they go into the magic .
and the commercial device costs about five thousand dollars up there or something , photonests about the fifth .
so it doesn &apos;t have the same efficiency , but it &apos;s basically practical .
so , right now that &apos;s the point of the scene right now to increase this availability of technology and also increase the information and comprehensive , that more people can be engaged in it .
because , as it said at the beginning , it &apos;s an extremely important technology , and most people have relatively little idea of it and also no opportunity to make it really good .
because if you read about it , from second world literature , that &apos;s not the same as you &apos;ve done it yourself or you &apos;ve seen it .
and i think technology is becoming more important in our modern societies .
and if you want to make meaningful choices in society , want to meet and talk , you need access to knowledge and technology .
and you have to do it and understand it and understand it .
and then it &apos;s under the headline of open knotaddge and citizen science .
so , as a citizen , you &apos;re being locked in the situation with these scientific technologies .
and that &apos;s the essence of the biomass .
these are the people who have attended to be an official on the website , d.i. , d.i.
that &apos;s a relatively remarkable number of people around the globe .
and what &apos;s interesting is that they &apos;re also in southern asia .
that &apos;s what i think there are fewer people there than actually existed .
so i know about some of them who didn &apos;t take care of .
and this is just the bicobians , the individual people .
and partly with these hackers , so they put these places together .
and that &apos;s really at the beginning .
as i said , it &apos;s just started .
and hardware , so the computer passport , because the candidate in berlin was the first one , nine hundred , ninety fifth .
and this is now a gigantic network of very good , yes , infrastructures that are set up all over the world .
and we hope , of course , that we &apos;re going to take a similar way , then , and then also have a similar amount of good news , so that even more people can be involved in people .
and i would invite everybody to engage with that and even try to do something about it .
now , it &apos;s not so simple , but it &apos;s not impossible , if you have enough curiosity and you put enough energy in there , you get too far .
thank you for listening .
that &apos;s it .
yeah , hello .
how do we actually work people ?
that &apos;s a question that is very moved to me as a designer , but also in the field of the research department and all the things in american science .
it &apos;s about how to meet people in interactive media so that they can use these interactive media and create a possible experience .
because i think that the interactive media in us archaic , cognitive models , is a paradigm that has been programmed in our biological memory very , very long time , and that we can just make it through interactive media .
and this is very amazing because you actually believe that these hollywood technologies that you &apos;re looking at is that you &apos;re actually getting into the future , but it &apos;s actually that the future is right at us in our archaic roots .
now , what are archaic models now ?
i &apos;ve been writing four style , and i &apos;d like to explain to you very quickly .
to archaic cognitive models , these are the models that we &apos;ve been doing in the prevalent times .
in these archaic models , we have basically natural relationship to virtuality .
basically that sounds unusual first .
but i &apos;m going to do it again , and i &apos;m going to prove to you a little bit about trying to have a natural relationship to virtuality .
the second thing is , since these archaic models , we &apos;re able to talk very , very visually , even though we &apos;re using a codiog language today .
and the third area , which is actually explaining itself .
we all know that the interactive media in definition of definition is nonlinear , which involves the linearity of the linearity , and what of course is that we find the linearity today .
the fourth point is that the story for us is a place of information .
now , what about virtuality that is actually the most natural thing in the world ?
i want to prove it to you that .
how many doors does the house in which they live ?
we won &apos;t be able to answer them immediately spontaneously , but it &apos;s going to happen , and right now .
they go in the spirit through this house where they live , and watch how many doors are there .
and that &apos;s exactly what they do .
they optimize reality , right without computers .
fantastic , right ?
and that &apos;s where we &apos;re at the media campus , for example , to represent virtual reality in our vacuum lab , and we can actually do that all the time .
and these assumptions that make virtual reality virtual , they have needed the people in the previous times , because they didn &apos;t have anything .
they didn &apos;t have books .
or they didn &apos;t have any photolingia .
they didn &apos;t have mass media .
the only thing that they had was their head .
and in that head , the memory came to mind .
and in this head , knowledge has been made , and with these virtual images , the imagination , they were also continued to know .
and so it &apos;s also so strong in us that we can deal with virtuality so well .
and the interesting thing is , if i can make a small trip .
yeah , it goes .
and the interesting thing about this is that at that time of man , the same thing was media productivity and medium itself .
now , if you think about a piece of progress now .
what are media today ?
then you &apos;ll notice that there &apos;s been a change .
but i &apos;ll talk to you about that again .
major tools of information guide have been stories since ever ever since .
harmful , priest , so-called knowledge problems , were extracted for extract to keep knowledge in stories .
and yet we still hang very , very , very strong on stories today .
the author of the book of the story of the story of the story of the story of the story of the story of the story of the story of the story of the story of stories , we &apos;re still comparing a thousand thousand hours with
this means for a child that spent it until the reach of the six-year-old , most of his life with the recipes of stories .
now , we think our love of stories is that we have sat down as a child on the lap of our parents .
no , no , no , far .
it goes far further back to the cultures of the prevalent times .
but for me , in the interactive media , as an impressive thing , we have persuasive per se in our biological memory , the ability to think nonlinear .
i &apos;ve brought an example to you from the north american tribe of the notopk indian tribe .
and life lived in the coast of british columbia .
and as you can see , this is a very , very island area , and you had to kind of navigate from island to island to raise food .
and they made this with so called lemonade maps .
you may know that , if you &apos;re a little bit interested in that , of the australian peoples .
they have similar principles .
they don &apos;t have leades of leades , but they &apos;ve used these kinds of nurses , or they have trajectories .
and what &apos;s interesting about this is that the navigation and the topography of regions could be trained by songs .
the language in which the language was interrupted by the underch .
that means you navigate sounds and about rhythm .
and these sounds and this rhythm have the geology , the topography of a region , and it also enabled that you could interfere with these songs and put them together and go back to the left , to the right , and again
why don &apos;t we sing more to come up from the top of a to b ?
anyway , to navigate .
what was actually happening ?
that &apos;s what happens to this naive machine age .
we &apos;ve moved before in what we call the bird age .
what happens is the machine age , and happens the book , and happens that &apos;s the photo photography .
and that &apos;s exactly what happens that we have the responsibility for our memories and the own production of our individual memories in external media .
on the book and the picture .
so unfortunately , we &apos;ve got god trying to virtual a piece of far .
virtuality has become fresh for us all , and has nothing to do with reality .
bruce brown , a famous design scheme at bigs university , has been so far to say that these mass media , he means the book and the image , not the tv , the internet , etc . , and so on , what we
let &apos;s make a small intermediation .
from the bird age to the machine age .
what has a impact on our thinking and our memories ?
then the underlying impact of anti-fired cultures is the underlying cultures .
and they &apos;ve been written more and more over the course of centuries more and more by the impacts of the machine age .
that means instead of remembering each other &apos;s standards , we have standardized , highly common , in mass destructive patterns of memories that we can rely on our personal memories .
we &apos;re no longer producing ourselves .
we have an abstract of an abstract language .
we don &apos;t think of the thing anymore in pictures that don &apos;t present things in images anymore , but we cook them our language .
we &apos;ve been used to things linear happening .
and we accepted the linearity as law , and there are only exceptions , like the nup linear .
what &apos;s left us is the story of the story .
still , we &apos;re still very , very arrested as a information medium .
the question is , what &apos;s going on ?
we had this -- we had the age age , we had the machine age , and we &apos;ve now called the cybercriminal .
it sounds very scary , and it sounds very pure to science fiction , i know .
but these concepts of cybercriminals , which are bringing us back to these possibilities again , backing our skills back to our skills .
there it is about virtuality , it &apos;s about nasalinlinity , it &apos;s about story satisfaction .
i want to explain a little bit about that for a second .
there are technical concepts like this , for example , the eyeside reality , which is the expanding reality .
so , for example , if you look at google glasses , for example , it &apos;s such a concept that requires us to combine the virtual world with the real world , which means our authority to virtually experience the virtual as something
another example is so called virtual reality .
so , of course , in the context of my talk , we may sound physically , and we &apos;re physically moving into not exposure , virtual worlds , right after the hotel of the holocaust .
and other examples are the ambient , intelligent systems .
these are rooms that can react to a human being .
all of this needs the ability to accept virtuality as a real living space .
i graduated from the video , and i hope that the video works , a very , very nice project , which is the bake work of michael burk , ann cattle , joris breakdown and janorer &apos;s disease .
and the two people are here today .
you might stand up for a second so that you can talk to the two about the project .
and this project , as an example , has brought me to an example of how again that archaic , cognitive models are being embedded .
the whole thing is a game , i have to say it .
and of course , the story of the story is extremely active , and it &apos;s a computer game .
and when i say computer games , you &apos;re very likely to be able to get some people up before any consequence , or they play with any consequence in your hand .
anyway they do that .
this is a game out there .
and that &apos;s thought that i discovered the outside world , so that i discover the real world .
and this game connects the virtual world , which is the data that we produce with the real world .
i apologize that i have to cut so much .
now you can explain that much better , and it &apos;s much more than that .
and that &apos;s why i discover a city by looking at where places are being twittered positively or negative .
and so i get a very different view of the city , which is a very different impression , which i see negative and positive zones of a city and gets a very different virtual map in this way of a very real virtual map .
and we &apos;d like to see that now .
ah , what you can see here , sorry , is another little explanation of what you &apos;re seeing right now .
of course , this virtual world lives in the walls of our cities , right ?
and with a kind of flashlight , we can see these virtual worlds visible .
so , i &apos;d like to conclude with this , and in the sense that the properties and the skills that we &apos;ve taken out of the vote , and they &apos;ve been so shattered to us in the machine age , which can be
thank you .
yeah , i &apos;m very happy to be with you .
i &apos;ve just been asked whether this is a bag there , and it &apos;s a retrofit , and i &apos;m going to talk about my instead .
it won &apos;t do it .
i &apos;m going to resolve what &apos;s inside there .
but i &apos;m not going to do it yet curiously .
yes , children are naturally curious , or should be curious , designers also .
i &apos;m an excerpt of house , of course , so i &apos;m also dealing with the issue of curiosity and how to change curiosity again , and why we may lose curiosity and have to reject it again and so on .
that &apos;s a whole series of things that you &apos;re engaging with as a creator .
when professors get curious , they &apos;re often replaced in southern explorers .
and that &apos;s also what i &apos;ve had in the last half year .
it &apos;s a research audience at the point of natural user interface design .
now you &apos;re going to ask yourself , why are the whole steps to be with so natural , archaic , of communication , interaction and so on .
and i just hold one of these little devices up because things should always become intuitive , more natural , useless , and you have to look at what is actually human , of course , for us humans , which is useless or intuitively
and in front of the background , i &apos;ve been in the area of natural user interface , so the next generation in the human computer in the relationship of the human computer is dealing with how our tools or how the computer is changing from the
so i &apos;ve been dealing with that when is that intuitive or intuitive .
maybe again , take a look at this .
why does this happen ?
so , if we look at the evolution of our society , here &apos;s a short line , we &apos;re now moving from the third to the fourth lear generation or living form .
so from modern to computer society .
every society is shaped by a primary medium .
at the beginning of the tribal society , through language .
that means that you &apos;ve found that you &apos;ve talked to a common language , you were able to communicate with each other , it &apos;s moved into the same cave , or in other areas , cities are educated or villages , and has designed so
but the primary medium was the language , something very natural , something very alive .
in fact , you had to learn , so no small child can talk about nature , but we &apos;re learning it , of course , primarily and for example .
it was then decreased by the ancient society and the first form of abstraction .
and that was a giant upcry , because , of course , the living language started to manipulate in the form of writing , which is what flight and life is alive , i start to get it in stone and i &apos;m also cheating
depending on how i grow and when i grow , it &apos;s of course a very different coverage than if there &apos;s a living kind of alive .
but then , sweeping this script as a primary medium , received retrain .
then the next generation that we &apos;re actually living in today is primarily primarily .
this is just the printing and pressing script writing with guns and others .
at the time , it was just a front of the afghan , where a buffalo , clinical and others said , are you really crazy when the people start reading , then the afternoon wants to talk , and of course , it &apos;s
and now we &apos;re going to go to the next generation , and the exciting thing is , this is just a couple of hundred years , and we &apos;re really in this phenomenal stage that we &apos;re doing something like that .
and of course , that &apos;s completely , of course , because we see the new media , the new media media , facebook and so on .
with total transparency , which is the new thinking , what &apos;s going on in the old thinking , don &apos;t say that in the flash of light and not beef is more or other phenomena , which is what i just want to do
and these two worlds are just looking at each other , new and old thinking .
the exciting thing is , if you look at this , this new society , this computer society , it requires a lot of mechanism , principles and archaic paradigm from the rich society .
but no longer at the local level , but on global level .
we understood that the weather is global .
that the subject ecology is a global one .
not when i think local thinking here and the neighbor thinks less ecologically , and then the whole thing doesn &apos;t work .
that means , from the local village , it &apos;s actually become a global village with the same principles , of course , possible intuitively , but the total transparency .
as you knew in the village at the time , who has something with whom and when , this is what &apos;s happening today about this extension of our self through these mobile endeavors on global level .
it is that we know how to create global knowledge and make it better faster and better .
it just like it happened on the village before .
so , before the background , i &apos;ve been busy looking at what does it actually mean for us , of course , but what we may have learned , what &apos;s instinctively , is instinctively , so what makes the difference ?
because often people don &apos;t get used to it , so they can &apos;t make it too friendly so that anybody can deal with it .
so you have to deal with it , which means that , and not only it changes it , it &apos;s different , it should also be better .
and when , of course , when i &apos;m intuitively intuitive , and how can i take a handle on this influence and make it really appropriate that it &apos;s a useless , so you can intuitively intuitively be intuitive
you &apos;re still engaging , also during the study , with the subject of perception and perception psychology .
and that &apos;s also , of course , where you start and look and say , okay , now i just look inside the inside .
and what &apos;s it going to be like in there ?
so how do we work when we look in there ?
and what does mean , of course , intuitively means , intuitively , how do our channels work in perception and how do the cognitive process ?
because steve jobs once said you &apos;re having nene to the middle of the road , it &apos;s working works .
so you really have to look at detail if i want to make something useless or intuitively handed , which is in the core .
and what you see is that one of our seven senses , most of us think we only have five , and now it &apos;s even seven in the future , there &apos;s certainly seven , eighth sense , and as an extension again , again ,
and to look at how do we process information , how do we take information ?
just to say , what is information ?
information is every difference that makes a difference .
many use the word , but i don &apos;t know what it means in detail .
but i have to understand in the core , understand when information can be information , when data can know information and information , so i know how to make things intuitively intuitively intuitive or intuitive .
and of course also , how design affects the perception .
we see this when i design things , and then i can make it confusing as on the right side , where i don &apos;t know what &apos;s salt and pepper , or i can sort of make it intuitively intuitive by showing things
so much more natural , it &apos;s in a vessels , but i kind of see right where salt and pepper in there .
and when i tell someone , let me give you salt or pepper , and then it &apos;s going to look at the right one , where &apos;s what &apos;s inside .
and on the left just intuitively , and i hope that there &apos;s no sugar in the left that squirts salt .
but also our perception of how to deceive it too .
for example , this perception in context .
the right circle looks bigger than the little , even though it &apos;s not the case , but they &apos;re just as big , and yet our perception changes , depending on what context we make .
does anybody know what that is ?
come on .
patters made recession work still .
there &apos;s a lot more to my glasses than that .
so it &apos;s not circle .
a second circle starts to correlate or associate a bit of similarity .
and if i take another one of them , we don &apos;t look at any one unit , which is circle , circle and , but we see one unit , we don &apos;t see three parts , a circle , a circle , another .
that &apos;s what &apos;s called a trailer or a fashion psychology that &apos;s also affecting us in perception .
important for designers , which is mostly the first semester , the great laws of laws .
the shape of closing , radiation of the continuity and so on .
often forgotten in the third one .
but this is a essential part of the essential part , if you can actually intuitively make things intuitively intuitive .
the next phenomenon , which is also very interesting to see this .
sounds very banal , but it &apos;s very exciting when you &apos;re engaging with it .
so we have the eyes on the front , and now we think we &apos;re seeing from front of the back .
that &apos;s wrong .
they &apos;re looking forward from behind to forward .
because they &apos;re projecting an assumption forward that they see something that they recognize , example , circle .
that means we &apos;re only projecting to see what we &apos;re seeing before we see it in the back back in our paradigms to say , okay .
i have such a cognitive jacqueline , you &apos;ve been projecting what you want to see .
so that &apos;s also there , then it comes back again .
and then it goes back to the front , because the back doesn &apos;t stop the front , and say , now i &apos;m going to look at the front , and i &apos;m sure if what you &apos;re seeing is what you want to see .
and then it goes back back , and then it &apos;s actually just seen .
so , a very exciting process of how certain things are going on and what these things are happening for milliseconds of millennium systems .
i don &apos;t know who &apos;s familiar with this picture .
there &apos;s exactly the same thing that i &apos;ve described to you about .
now everybody from this pattern is trying to see something .
i don &apos;t know who recognizes what &apos;s going on .
anybody see anything like that ?
a dragoner , exactly .
if i &apos;ve seen that , that there &apos;s a dragoner in there , you know that .
you &apos;ll never forget it anymore because i &apos;ll show you where the dragoner is .
now you see the dragonfly .
and furthermore , now you &apos;re always looking at it .
so , i &apos;ve actually suggested her now that they don &apos;t recognize a pattern in there , but i &apos;ve contained them in a very short time , always to see this dog in this bloody picture .
and this is this projection of seeing , feedback axes .
now i know about it now , and now i &apos;m going to see this project that i see the dragonfly .
i see the dragonfly .
so , very exciting processes that then in this , yes , gray , it &apos;s actually not , but here &apos;s just not going on in this roan mass .
does anybody know what three seconds is ?
long , yeah .
that &apos;s our present present .
so , it &apos;s also interesting to know as a designer .
if i know something about three seconds , until i kind of get out of the present , i can also bridge very good waiting for him by dealing with someone with three seconds .
it just has to process as a present present .
then it goes into the past , and so i can bridge very elegant waiting for example on the computer when i know this phenomenon .
what takes five-dimensional milliseconds ?
yes , millennia .
also , a very exciting phenomenon .
this is the time you fall in love with this .
that means acute , if you know that now , pay attention to if you look like this , because i don &apos;t take a curve for what can be happening in the same way .
and 60 milliseconds , also a very exciting phenomenon .
that &apos;s the time of most of the perceptions we have .
that means that the first impression happens in a rapid speed of how we perceive things .
and as we see things , what we &apos;re looking at , and how we &apos;re sort of distinguished against our environment , so we can think about it .
of course , the designers don &apos;t just engage with the subject and neural processing or cognition , but primarily , of course , with the subject of the human object .
so how a human being is concerned with certain things .
there &apos;s once more comfortable the practical functions , so stunning aspects or formalatical aspects .
there are signs where i know exactly where i have to reach .
but there &apos;s also symbolic functions , why is someone going to be a little bit like this , where it &apos;s hard for why it &apos;s hard , so horrible amounts of money , even though it &apos;s not so practical ?
and we &apos;re more likely to be on the symbolic , on the level that we also engage with as a creator .
back to my actual subject of natural user interface and the subject , which of course is beyond , is the survey .
unprity always means how i can get a certain goal , or how can a user get possible in a specific contribution to a specific value text , efficient and adventure .
it &apos;s like saying that to the norm .
how can i make something possible use useless ?
can i use that right , or don &apos;t need the no manual , or i need to do it .
and fewer unables , or use friendly , is it .
that i &apos;m just designed to make it more and more beautiful , doesn &apos;t mean it &apos;s better .
you have to understand that too .
and then , if you &apos;re part of the software that we &apos;ve just seen , look at this , you &apos;re also going to understand why nine and a half percent of our today &apos;s software are intuitively used or not to be able to use
and intuitively , intuitive users have not only been a elementary economic factor , so that elementary success , if i want to use technical devices to make people harness .
why ?
because , in principle , we &apos;re going through this new kind of habitat , which is the natural user of hypnotic , for example , five times faster on our goal .
you have to imagine that if you make some of the classical properties , five hours need , and with this new kind of natural software only one hour .
it doesn &apos;t mean that you can probably go home four hours more and more , but you &apos;ll have your employer , or you &apos;re going to have someone to do it with four hours .
but i want to say that , of course , it &apos;s an unprecedented achievement , also certain things to make certain things .
so if we put ourselves in the software in the software here , the first commitment of linear interfaces , which was very abstract , where you needed months to deal with these systems .
then the next ones that have already been working with the radio neural model , mental model , worked like the software of the software , which is that you have an idea of something , the metaphor , the metaphor of a desktop to make the
so no more zeros and one or critical code , but just a metaphor .
it &apos;s actually made it more useless , but it &apos;s also much better , of course .
the next generation of graphic users work much more with behaviors .
so that &apos;s where i form a lot more often than a designer , a lot more often than look .
this is also a paradigm shift .
that i suddenly think that looks more important to success , just the survey is an application .
and when i go down to this natural user interface , where i have a voice , a language , a towel , a gesture and no longer per mouse and a cursor that needs to control things , then i &apos;m even more immediate .
but that also leads me to the point , and when are things going to actually become intuitive ?
if you get intuitive , and then i have to stress my little friend here and see , what does that mean in terms of cognition , when is it actually intuitively intuitive ?
and that &apos;s for us humans , always intuitively intuitively , if i can think about it a little bit .
so he doesn &apos;t seem to think , but he doesn &apos;t like to think about it .
the less i think about it , the more intuitive it is .
and what does that mean for designers ?
that means that when we look at that we can transfer existing actions from one to something else , for example , the metaphor , and then i can use that as a creator .
that means i can translate an intuitive , a human action , and make the software more useful to make the software more useless .
so , of course , the question is , what is the intuitive action of us people , and now i &apos;ve been revealing it .
that &apos;s what &apos;s called the origin model .
that uses each of us , and it &apos;s an acronym , and it stands for orientation , selects , informing , transporting .
that makes each of them all the time , but it makes it unconsciously and kind of intuitive or partially intuitive .
and the model is already shaped in the womb , and it &apos;s cultural , so it works in the world at young and old , and it &apos;s used by us all the time without most of us knowing that this model is present .
it turns around about 50 to 70 thousand times of us at activity , so in the sleep , you &apos;ve noticed that it &apos;s less often detected than a day .
i can now orient this mental act of action , select , inform , transport , translate to an interaction system .
and through this kind of transmission , similar to the metaphor of the desktop , now no longer a metaphor of a physical object , but a metaphor of a commodity , a action network .
and this is on a higher gray of use authority than the transmission of a classical metaphor , which is the desktop .
and if i &apos;m carrying this up , for example , in which i extend orientation as an argument , selecting as a choice , it &apos;s big to me , i can look at it in detail , and yes , transaction , i
then i can transmit the whole thing .
i &apos;m going to try one for example .
everyone &apos;s ever eaten cake .
overview : now i &apos;m kind of interacting with the object , can zoom out again , zoom in .
i &apos;m going to get it all over here , can now filter up here and can say , just show me all about chocolate .
and once again , an interface , which is much more intuitive and much more natural .
because that i can reach things like the pieces , and to come to me , and they come up to me , is much more natural than if on the scientific organized websites , or other mechanisms , they can somehow make these things available .
imagination is moore is molecular katamed , and with that sentence , i &apos;d like to conclude to give a point , and designers need to think differently , to get to new solutions , and in that sense , i thank you very much
i want to give you a very particular aspect of curiosity .
the first one , if you get a big child than baby , is that you take care of what disabilities you have , right ? and depend on whether your parents allowed them to play more or less in the sounds , the more , you know
and curiosity doesn &apos;t learn .
so all that are here and curious is , indeed , people who have a property that you can &apos;t learn .
i &apos;m doing it now , basically this whole environmental debate , world wages , 40 years of club-off rome , in quality .
and there &apos;s a central point there .
and it depends on phosphorus .
poeve pets a chance .
and every day they give them a scale of scale about two grams of phosphorus , and every day they have to take two grams of phosphorus .
otherwise you can &apos;t have teeth .
you can &apos;t store energy .
you can &apos;t have bone .
we could only miss as an amorphous pooperation through the world sea .
if we don &apos;t actually take phosphorus and leave .
what &apos;s amazing about this is that we &apos;re here with something that &apos;s really , really obvious , but not like that .
because all of the talk about energy , but nobody talks about the phosphorus-based problem .
the phosphorus problem is much more critical .
we depend on two countries .
we only have a lot of phosphorus for two years of phosphorus , and now through the phosphorus mining of the world , there &apos;s much more uranium in the environment than it &apos;s used in all the blobs .
in the last 20 years alone , five thousand tons of uranium have been distributed on our fields in germany .
and we &apos;ll take that all together .
it makes leukemia in children .
and we think we would protect the environment if we &apos;re a little less harmful .
so , for example , protected the environment , far less car .
protect the environment , make less waste .
protect the environment , use less energy .
but that &apos;s not protection .
it &apos;s like i would say , useful your child , just three times instead of five .
it &apos;s just a little less destruction .
so if we think about the way to the market , our entire earth is going to be used to be a cemetery .
this is just about thinking about the way we think .
and the most important thing about looking at the ground is first .
there &apos;s over 60,000 percent of carbon in the ground .
right now we &apos;re building corn and losing between 11 and 37 kilograms per hectare per hectare , or calculating in the square meter .
that means we &apos;re losing about five thousand times more than new .
of course , we can only see the trash problem .
and everything is a packaging or content .
for example , in china , the house trash is 20 percent of the waste of waste now .
and because we get older , the winds become bigger .
it &apos;s kind of like all of them in the lower infected .
yes ?
one baby takes about six thousand claws .
we could of course reduce that by 10 percent , but what does that do ?
this is balanced in china in a second .
this is completely relief .
so the question is , how do we deal with these winds ?
so here &apos;s the proof that men are not a pig .
let me tell you .
because the phosphorus is given to the fragmented pieces of extinctions .
people over the urine .
yeah .
so with that , men can &apos;t be pigs .
because that &apos;s what it &apos;s like , isn &apos;t it ?
traditionally , we think in the environmental debate , we &apos;re too many in the world .
and if you give the people that if you have the people to exist , if you say that would be better , you &apos;re not there , then you get smart and hostile .
and so someone like al gore , one of our great heroes , is nothing more important than stabilizing human population .
in israel , if you save a human life , you &apos;d buy the earth .
here it says the more you kill , the better you kill .
yeah .
the first question is , are we really too many ?
if you look at the ants , the weight of the ants on earth , then the ants make about four times more than we humans .
i could also take termites , but in the united states , no one termites , in that way , even though they &apos;re vegetarians .
that means the ants are much more than us .
and because she &apos;s physically working in a lot harder than we are , and because they live only three to six months , they &apos;re in their weight , in the energy consumption , a little bit of three billion people .
that means we &apos;re not too many , we &apos;re too stupid , yes ?
and where you see how far we &apos;re going out , what we could really do , and how sad we are , that we &apos;re at all on the earth , and you can see that , for example , there &apos;s a program , up to 20
you can only be clustered if you don &apos;t exist , yes ?
the only chance .
have you ever seen a clinical tree ?
yes ?
one ?
that means our entire intelligence means that we want to be dumber as a tree , right ?
yes ?
no tree is carbon neutral .
fortunately not , yes ?
there is no overpopulation population .
there are still six billion trees in the amazon area alone in the amazon area alone .
you &apos;ve heard some of the overall populations of trees ?
that means all our intelligence means that we want to be dumber as a trees .
and where you see , even at something like deter , the strainest biofuels , it doesn &apos;t allow our own metabolism to go back .
every year we lose three million tons of phosphorus , which really have to go back in circles .
and we are too many .
alone .
that means we feel so guilty of the earth that we say , and there &apos;s no biotech building , no bioland , no natural control and how they &apos;re all called that allow our own extinctions to go back .
isn &apos;t that sad ?
that &apos;s where we are too many .
it &apos;s safe to be less harmful about what oil consumption is about .
but where are we useful ?
we &apos;re trying to minimize our ecological footprint , but it &apos;s about having a big footprint that &apos;s useful .
we want to be good for society , we want to be good for economics , but when it comes to environment , it &apos;s the highest , not to be there , yes ?
nuclear silk , yes ?
you can only have nuclear electrons if you &apos;re not there .
even if you were shooting now , you would have emissions .
so you can &apos;t solve that .
we can do it differently .
we can regain our nutrients .
we &apos;re doing the agriculture in brazil , where we regain nutrients .
right , we can get back to this kind of nutritional nutrient in agriculture .
we &apos;re doing this in china , for example , where we &apos;re taking the accidents off .
in china , a nightmare today is still host of the night , like , yes ?
and in our western world we were always too stupid to bring our nutrients back .
that means the whole western civilization is drawing by the fact that the city has always taken , but the farmers never gave back .
so the cities had to grow more , because the farmers went to cities , and the cities had to keep getting their nutritional nutrients .
so all the western rich are always expanding until they haven &apos;t done the infrastructure anymore , and then they &apos;re impressed .
yes ?
in china it was different .
you &apos;ve managed to get ched civilization over five thousand years because you were always able to bring nutrients back .
even today , if you &apos;re invited to dinner in china , you expect for the food to stay so long until you pick up the toilet .
because it &apos;s unfriendly to go and take the nutrients .
you &apos;ve invited them to dinner , not for the nutmareas .
that means you can see on the internet how to regain nutrients .
it &apos;s actually beautiful when you do that , so agriculture makes , biogas , on a hectare of land with five thousand people in favelas , can make a building about a thousand dollars and wait for the plant to wait chickens and
and the great thing about this is that the dictionaries go back over 50 percent favelas .
so we don &apos;t need to control people to be more bad .
we can support them to be good .
this is high-tech agriculture , of course , but the facilities are carrying themselves .
the side product is clean water .
and they &apos;re designed , by the design that a building can easily prove .
that means that the crime is going back .
and none of these things , we &apos;ve now built over 100,000 in the last 20 years , none of these accurates have ever been scarted .
you could just throw a liter of aloil , and then the plant would be ruined for years .
not happening .
that means we don &apos;t have to control people , make it possible .
we can support them to be good .
that means we have to get phosphorus back .
and by the way , if you want to do what you want to do from it , you write up , in germany , at the best level of all the potatoes , it &apos;s in france .
unfortunately , that &apos;s not in touch , but maybe you can actually help the france for a little bit .
because the france is capable of regaining the phosphorus .
and that has got to go back .
we see that that phosphorus is really critical .
and we see that it works .
we &apos;ve been using over three years now in holland .
the dutch government has explained , you &apos;re going to be the first country in the world , which is phosphorus .
but we need all of that .
you know , there are two countries that control almost 70 percent of the phosphorus-based world .
there &apos;s opec a bunch of waisrty people .
these are six-year-old countries that control four percent of oil spills .
and the oil will replace us by other energy drugs .
but the phosphorus will not replace .
that &apos;s not about making the existing a little bit bad , but it &apos;s about making something right .
and it &apos;s first to wonder what the right thing is .
that means it &apos;s about efficiency , not about efficiency .
in holland , it &apos;s easier to understand , because in holland , the country is built on flowers .
yes ?
imagine if your wife is sad , if you have a little bit over you , and you get with 50 roles .
totally inefficient .
but absolutely and effectively , yes ?
or take a limb .
a woman in germany is about six tomathree three kilograms in their lives .
here .
it &apos;s not quite accurate because we don &apos;t know how much waste is going to be .
but a limb , even in this lighting , can tell you it &apos;s completely inefficient , but it &apos;s completely effective , yes ?
one of the things that is beautiful in life is not efficient .
that &apos;s not the resource efficiency , it &apos;s efficiency .
to ask , what is the right thing ?
not to burn the average lamb even a little bit better and put it down with it and put it in the burning of the whole materials for circular circles , but first to ask , how do you contain circles ?
imagine mozart efficient .
yes ?
when i invite you to dinner and say , yes , there &apos;s a tablet with open-hand flavor and a glass of water .
wonderful , huh ?
that &apos;s efficient .
everything that is beautiful in life is not efficient .
if you fall in love with somebody , efficient ?
yes ?
that means everything counts in life is not about saving , avoiding .
all the environmental discussion .
we say to people , well , you don &apos;t have an environment in the south .
no , the way to throw away is exactly the right thing , right ?
at any point where you take away , from , yes , you do again , again , life possibilities .
but the wrong stuff .
if you run the wrong things , you have a trash problem .
we think of north as we think of it .
there &apos;s every footprint there .
when you walk , yes , every footprint destroys the floor .
because the way the moose is going to die , and the wind and the water is dropping down the floor .
if you &apos;re in italy , every footprint means that the water is longer in the meadow .
so , it &apos;s about creating a big footprint that &apos;s going to be a mutation .
not department .
we say in germany sustainability .
yes ?
but when i ask you , how are you with your wife ?
what do you say then ?
sustainable .
and then i say , good susorry , yeah ?
that &apos;s just the minimum .
so saving is not saving , announcing , avoiding .
every waste is nutrition .
and it &apos;s a luck when you see in italy , how people in the high bow like this are dropped out of the car like that .
because you know , it &apos;s a funny process .
it &apos;s not the form of revenue , right ?
you can show , i was there .
but with the right design , please .
for example , we developed an ice package of ice packages , which is in space temperature .
they can turn them away where they go and stand .
in two hours , it builds up everywhere .
and it contains seeds of rare plants so that they contribute to biodiversity .
that means we are useful , not less harmful .
so it comes two circles .
not everything should be habitat .
and a tv machine or a washing machine , they just use them , they don &apos;t use them .
just the things that disrupt , like shooting , like brazil , like authorities , who have to be that they go in biological systems .
the things that are only being used are going into technical systems .
but today we &apos;re just talking about the biological systems .
yes ?
for example , the shrimp , yes ?
just direct advertising , not for the company puppe per se , but for that you &apos;re helping this company successfully to make these products successful .
because we don &apos;t do things more free .
yes ?
so if i invite them to dinner and say , this is free from chicken , and then they don &apos;t help them .
no , we &apos;re discovering what &apos;s inside .
positive .
so , not like detox .
not toxic .
but everything that is inside is useful .
these are the first shoes that you can put the cavaly on the pedestrian , and go into organic circles , right ?
all of that is comfortable .
and if we do that , of course , it &apos;s going to happen for adilizing , for nike , for hennes and maritia and the entire textile industry .
and that &apos;s half of all the waterwater problems around the world are caused by the textile industry .
that &apos;s why they help there , ask for the people .
hey , pupia , are you really serious ?
because they &apos;ve already changed twice the presidential world .
and i &apos;m not so sure whether they really relate to it .
so , just help me a little bit .
but it goes .
yeah .
what &apos;s been shown right now .
this is .
so we can do the things that you can do when you break , when you break , you can put in biological circles .
the technical circles are the same way .
there &apos;s a direct backyard system for this for this .
this is the first ecological backpack , which is actually made to go back into the cycle .
so also that , in every store you can get things back .
if you come to this , yeah ?
remember the winds again ?
at the moment , the trash .
everywhere those winds are around , near .
in the countries where people get money .
in front of the detectors , but elsewhere in the landscape , yes ?
if we change the plastics so that it can go in biological systems , if we change the water support , in the inside that it can just return to cellular ground , you can plant a baby in israel or tunisia in tunisia
yes ?
and just if you take those winds , you take them smaller , sterilized and sterile and the powder to plant trees .
with that , the baby carbon is carbon to life , from the beginning .
so , we don &apos;t need to be clinically , we can be a contractor .
it &apos;s kind of a fucking poop pride .
yeah , it &apos;s kind of .
yes ?
we can do that .
we can &apos;t reinvent anything again .
i started an institute on this .
there are lots of people working with me now , and they &apos;re all engaged .
there &apos;s extra part of that , cradle tolelets , where everyone can be dealing with it .
no longer saving , announced , avoiding , reducing , reducing no school , but intelligent waste .
does that make it curious ?
thank you .
work of interpretation .
music as language .
in the description of my speech , i &apos;m written as an interpretation , i &apos;m as an translator , so in the english sense , understanding .
interpretation are translators of the written notes in beijing music .
that as a translator , you don &apos;t have to translate the text for word in a different language , but also have to understand the deeper sense of words and word clubs to make it a meaningful translation , anybody knows to do it
already translating from the germans into english can require more knowledge , except if it comes to poetry or even about poetry .
it &apos;s very strange for laughter , but what we &apos;re doing with our music language .
as an interpretation of a music piece , i first have the written notes .
you &apos;re sure that the component in the notes has written exactly everything that he imagined .
in fact , the notes are very vague and unprecedented .
these notes are about the same , or unprecedented , like a verbal , if it &apos;s very seemingly seemingly related to a landscape .
because in this verbal landscape , the smell of flowers is not to smell the degree of the green , just to listen to the spectrum of the winner , not to feel .
that means that the interpretation needs to translate this unified process of language into another , most accurate , concrete , nonverbal music language .
today , i want to share with you what i otherwise translate musical translates to , so interpret , again , translate into a verbal language .
basically a translation of translation .
so i prefer to do the whole thing on german , because if i had to translate into english again , it would be insignificant to me in translation of translation .
so , the music works for me as well as the spoken language .
the blades have the function of the letter of a writing .
so it &apos;s not enough to learn to read notes and press the tags on the piano or the right place on a virtually .
because these were just the letters that you learned to paint .
the characters &apos; point of letters can only recognize if you can do the language .
so for the learning process , the music process is at least as long as the spoken language .
so there &apos;s also a distinction , whether you learn it for the house use , you can only understand passively , or you can speak actively to the musical native speaker .
the interpretation of the interpretation begins to look like a theater monitor .
after one piece to play a piece , because you &apos;re excited about it , you &apos;re just studying the composition of composition .
you collect information about the piece in the second world literature .
you read in the letters , journalists , notes , or whether it &apos;s words , thoughts of composer themselves .
you study the works that he told us before and after .
you make it comparable .
the movements to write it .
how and what did he refer to ?
how were his circumstances , how about the society and the politics ?
i &apos;m interested in that .
you think of yourself in this time by looking at contemporary images , for example , or reading literature .
but over time , you have an interpretation of a rich knowledge of the composer that you play more often , and it &apos;s always getting easier to think and feel in it .
the component becomes more and more for the friend that you live with together .
his cause to write the piece is getting more and more and more and more to my personal cause to play it .
now , the grades represent everything else as an accurate record of the composer , but just a framework , now i &apos;m going to turn this scaffold to put it back with meaning and meaning .
i then say , with my own words , what could be written between this scaffold .
i &apos;m playing out what these sounds might have meant .
now for me and for the composer at the time , and what you might now mean today for him .
every sound , every phrase makes a sense because i feel it myself because it &apos;s from my person now .
it &apos;s got to be stimulated for me in here and now , and i can &apos;t convince my audience to convince me that that &apos;s my cause .
and it &apos;s always a very happy concert , if i can have the experience , the piece that i &apos;ve been exploring as long as we &apos;ve been working on .
and as you see a happy new day , even though there &apos;s all the same rituals of life , up , breakfast , go to work , i also experience the same piece in the same way again .
i &apos;ll get older again that &apos;s going to shift seasons , my pulse goes slowing down at night as the morning , in a concert hall , it takes a longer time to come back as at home .
i &apos;m going to take the breathing of the audience , consciously , or unconsciously .
all that affects me and all that impacts my experience with composition .
it &apos;s wonderful when i stand on the stage with a duo-mate on stage , and we have the same wavelength .
then the same is happening in a good , angry conversation .
you bring a new idea in , and that &apos;s what it &apos;s responding to with a reaction .
so it &apos;s exciting because then things that we haven &apos;t tried so much , and what you can &apos;t sample .
it &apos;s great fun to make music that way , and you &apos;ve seen the audience , you &apos;ve seen the music communicating alive .
so every concert is another concert .
i will never play any more like that moment .
i can &apos;t play as play today in 20 years .
i &apos;m going to have more life experience than today , and therefore , on my palette of music sounds , there &apos;s much more color of music and emotion and emotion than today .
sure , so i &apos;m going to get some farmers &apos;s buildings out there , but get new .
has a nice real example of this .
it was on a piano survey for musicians in my beloved old teachers , professor jewish , a famous beethoven specialist , concert platform and long-term professor of music school here in shrimp .
unfortunately , i was a lot too young so that he was designed when i finally started studying .
but i had the great fortune to meet him very early , at 10 years , and i was at my school time .
i was 17 when i went back to one of his courses again and played the last one of the four ballads of chopin , a collaboration .
he asked me what the introduction of this balloon was for me .
this is a part of a bag .
and in my judgment , i said , expectation .
and then he limited and said , like that ?
that must be the opportunity .
because for me , she means memory .
he was already over 60 .
well , at 77 you have dreams still , but not significant memories .
i &apos;m playing the piece of all the time over every couple of years and always changed it for me , even though not a single note changed .
it &apos;s exciting every time , because over and over , i read something new .
one example of that from a very different area . mosquito has painted the saerer x times .
it &apos;s always the same garden , but at a very different time , at different light .
he &apos;s translated the seerers differently , as he saw her , just like she did at that moment .
his personal depression of the seerer .
the x-painting interpretation of a piece is that comparable .
so now i &apos;m older than chopin at two times years when he wrote the piece .
he lived only nine and a half years .
and it &apos;s important to look back into the notes , even though i think you can exchange them .
keep marine language right with the composer .
because the notes are the only connection to him .
especially if it &apos;s died already .
now , how do you start talking about the language of music ?
i said yes , it &apos;s about as long as the spoken language .
often the music class is so you learn to read the notes .
you &apos;re basically learning to read that before you talk only one word .
you learn to find the notes to the notes on the instrument .
when all of the fingers in the room and right just like it stands in the notes , they get sound out of the way that they sound like music .
when the vulnerability happens , the student gets the next little piece .
they won &apos;t talk about interpretation very much in the remote class .
all right , there &apos;s prosperity on the front , that &apos;s a fast piece .
leek , slowly .
loud and silent , f and b , etc . , etc .
that &apos;s what most of you know here .
but also , if you translate these tools , it still leaves just something technical .
yet , it &apos;s always not interpretation .
i wonder .
i wonder that you often forget something elementary .
which is that to make music on the instrument that should do their musical and be felt before .
that sing the sing .
a child who didn &apos;t learn the sing because it didn &apos;t have the parents , it &apos;s not going to do it by itself .
it &apos;s like learning .
it &apos;s necessary to have his own experiences and ideas of music , and then it &apos;s about another possibility , about an instrument to sound .
people who have never sat down have never felt in the middle of their own body , what it &apos;s like to form a sound .
it &apos;s designing a phrase with his own breath .
because the music instrument is the extension of our body .
our vocal chords to sing , our hands and feet to dance .
so the hot spots in the piano are the sequel of my finger .
the melody comes from the creation and the rhythm from the dance .
the duration of life today is not properly proper .
you don &apos;t need to make music anymore if it gets boring .
no longer need a song to whistle or sing a song .
every piece of music is going to take place , if you &apos;re constantly complaining from the outside out of music .
sure , there are some of you who say , yes , but what do you do if i can &apos;t sing ?
the question i ask you , can you sing , a , because you believe you can &apos;t sing ?
or b , because they didn &apos;t learn to sing ?
in both , it &apos;s not too late to figure out if you can &apos;t , or learn how to hire these little muscles , use the vocal chords , use right .
because you can train that .
or c , because you seem to have felt about them .
and i wonder how much competent was this diagnosis ?
have you got a second , or a third opinion , as you say it beautiful today ?
or d , you don &apos;t like music , and you want to have noxty to do it .
but what i would regret , because music is a beautiful , communication thing .
but maybe you can still agree .
well , you know , you don &apos;t have to be an exclusive candidate .
but say , please , i don &apos;t know about classical music .
i can &apos;t tell if it &apos;s good or bad .
and i say , but surely you can tell if they like it or not .
because i don &apos;t think it says somebody , i don &apos;t know if it tastes to me because i can &apos;t cook .
so they don &apos;t tell the food because they can &apos;t cook .
so they don &apos;t have to tell classical music because they don &apos;t play an instrument .
listen consciously and tell if it tastes to them or not .
whether your music is too sweet or too sweet .
tell the thing that you &apos;re feeling .
and over time they get a breakthrough , and they want to get a little bit of time in there or taste fine differences .
now , why am i demanding now from my audience that it listening actively ?
because the music is a language and a language is to communicate .
it &apos;s a piece of art that you never look at , has no power .
the food that has been loved by a chef or a chef has got to be eaten lovely , and not just looked at recipes or regret .
so listen to if a music is played .
it &apos;s not just a nice little sound .
if in an environment where adults can make active music or at least be active music , a child grows , it &apos;s very easy for a musician , to ask , what color does your flower have ?
can you play them in blue as well ?
and the child plays , after a memorial , instead of before a red , a blue flower .
and that sounds very different from before .
so that was the first beginning of a own musical expression .
so the first step to interpretation .
and what happens if you played a piece of today that was written in the origin of a hundred , two hundred or even three hundred years ago ?
now , the instruments have places .
there was no piano at the time as an instrument .
it wasn &apos;t invented yet .
i think the ba would have been thrilled if he had the sound possibilities of today &apos;s modern pileter .
i can now get the characters that have had the bake on the modern wing , which can &apos;t be a barcker cigbette .
and also , beethoven knows that he heard more than he got deaf .
today , a modern orchestra is able to play everything that has removed an orchestra from then .
so the composers on us are interpreted to us that reinvent the pieces again .
they &apos;re going to be raised up , which they just imagined in the spirit .
and also what you would think in the spirit today .
or what i think today is because what you might have thought .
thank you .
do you know what dress ?
have you ever been tired ?
and how did that feel ?
embrace .
i have a friend , which drives a fabric .
and when i come from , with my little van wry , and i &apos;m standing at the edge of this feeling , this feeling is coming up .
i shoot something through your head .
i say , ulf , what do you need such a big car ?
that &apos;s been losing half his value for the first year .
and at all , you work much less than i do .
why do i have to afford that little car ?
and then i immediately fall into this , which is unfair .
it &apos;s against justice .
and as i say the word justice , this unpleasant feeling is gone .
our organism invented a great method to just make unpleasant feelings like envy just to disappear .
you can also try it with words like revenge or wine or something .
i want to explain to you today about this mechanism today or something that is unconscious to you .
the mechanism comes from the lie .
but don &apos;t think about the lie , as you may have heard , when people say no one has the intention of building a wall .
and then stored stones so that he &apos;s going to be able to get them to see the eyes .
on one of these lies , you see that the liars themselves don &apos;t believe what he says .
it makes it easy for us to test that it &apos;s very different in mind .
he &apos;s just demonstrating them and not themselves .
no , the lie i &apos;m talking about , which has to do with dececting yourself .
you need these lie to get a lift up to get a self-deception .
they can bring them less easily , yes , check , or even bring it to a bite .
they need time .
from that time , an anecdote is talking you may know .
the spanish painter pablo picasso once portrayed a woman .
and then this woman complained , the portrait wouldn &apos;t look like it .
picasso says , just wait .
it keeps getting more similar to them .
at this point and when you laugh , you see how important this lie is and how much time you need to experience what artists are able to tell us very well .
because artists have a defined relationship to lying .
the artist shares them something with them , and especially this lady , which she doesn &apos;t see , if she just looks in the mirror .
the artist shares you with something like this portrait , which you &apos;re just going to be familiar with when you &apos;re looking at this piece of art .
and then this awkward feeling disappears , and you can &apos;t see them similar at all , and it gets more similar to them .
here they have this mechanism that we can use the lie as a great invention to stabilize our lifespan .
and not only in art , also in the people in the people in the mythology , in stories it appeared again .
you may know this idea of the lady that looked at every morning in the mirror and asked him who is the most beautiful throughout the country ?
one day , this mirror says , yes , there &apos;s a nicer .
behind the seven mountains and so on .
and they also know how much hostility of this true statement , even the mirror can &apos;t lie out of this true statement .
but we should just be familiar with that that you can &apos;t tell a woman that there &apos;s a beauty somewhere else .
it &apos;s needed what we &apos;re understanding under political candidates over the course of politics .
we need this lie that we need to get out of the deception , without any that we can &apos;t reach .
we don &apos;t only have in art , in the people of nature , but also these great lies in science .
and there is this story from the children of the oyster of monster .
she heard about this book of charles darwin , the emergence of the species and the destruction of the human .
that the person had to escape from monkeys , and , yes , it would be a common ancestor between people and monkeys .
and then they ran up to her husband and said , well , that &apos;s probably not true what charles is writing there .
the human being should come from the monkeys or have a common ancestor .
no , no , it &apos;s not .
and if it &apos;s true , we have to prevent people to know about it .
why do we need people to know about something if it &apos;s true ?
because we can &apos;t live without these forms of life .
because we have this self-deception , this feeling of being great , deserved of the highest creatures , not from one such thing , from such unexpected as an organism that exists , compared to a stone , and anything like that , that
so , we can &apos;t do these things .
we need to prevent the people who get knowledge of things , especially when they &apos;re true .
so you can see how slowly these mechanisms release and like the traces that are leaving on something else that leads to something else that is in this great image of ourselves , i want to get to you another story .
a particularly beautiful story , as i mean .
my wife told them to me .
she came from school one day , she &apos;s a teacher , she told by a student .
a autistic student .
she likes to love him , especially because he has a tendency to accuracy .
and she asked him , what are your hobbies ?
and then he says , well , i &apos;m at the fireman .
and because i &apos;m in the firefighter , i &apos;m interested in parutute things .
yes , you &apos;ve got it when you &apos;re hotter at that point . there &apos;s nothing wrong .
i told my wife every time a man in a moral legal was using the lamk because used , we should try to replace it through the wall .
do that once , and then you hear the sentence .
even though i &apos;m in the firefighter , i &apos;m interested in parutute things .
you feel that , that &apos;s the actual truth behind it .
this is a little bust that doesn &apos;t interest for you .
it &apos;s interested in fire .
but there &apos;s no corporation that we can look at where you learn how to make fire .
there &apos;s just the second best thing , the firefighter .
and he signed it up .
and so , you know , you don &apos;t say his teacher , you like to put bread somewhere , and you &apos;re happy when the fire is getting up afterwards .
no , it just looks much better when we show that we are in charge of getting the risks that others only make when they put fire .
here you have this little mechanism .
this suggestion that in the core of the boat , it actually knew that it &apos;s actually related to the fire , but that he can &apos;t say that .
here they have this sensor between the unconscious and the conscious , which is immediately going on , without being able to do something about it , and the things that you know that they look very different is that they can sound much better for them and
so it &apos;s just like these words that we &apos;re using in the language of political correct speech .
in fact , we know something else is .
but we know when we say that , the social relationship is very sensitive .
we can &apos;t just do that .
it &apos;s impossible to present these things in a society that should work .
so i want to show you what we found in my institute .
after the logic of the deception , this self-deception , the willingness , a different reality than the ones we &apos;re actually in unconscious knowledge , it &apos;s valid .
here i want to give you two , maybe three examples .
the first example shows what many of you know and some of them appreciate , very few of them at all .
i mean the soul .
what &apos;s the soul ?
so the soul is kind of intellectual , it says about leibniz .
it &apos;s something that is not from stop , physical nature .
and if you have people who are the most compelling beliefs that they have a soul , or you can also say that they have been brought to life from the soul , they think it &apos;s like the soul is such a mental framework
and so from this soul , you think that somehow it &apos;s kind of in this cloudy nature , in this physical nature , an ant , it &apos;s in the latin , the craft , present , present .
and when this creature takes over people , then it &apos;s filled with dignity , with mind , with nature that can only live , but just with soul .
and then it can just run out .
that &apos;s the way the soul works .
so she should come from outside to the human .
so we should perceive them as something , which is supposed to be present for our lives .
and if you have this preconception , you understand the logic that we &apos;re experiencing that happiness through a lie can improve our world .
because now you can apply a drink .
so , you know , drice oil is still familiar from school .
now this is a drink that describes us an logic .
that &apos;s the hardest part in my talk , by the way .
here you need some logic , but you need the willingness to lie .
because of that , lying is so you can just apply this logic wrong .
there are three sentences in this disaster .
the first sentence is , clustered , there &apos;s no soul .
so the second sentence is when cure is right , so he doesn &apos;t have soul .
now there &apos;s a third sentence .
i came up with something special here .
a third sentence that immediately shows up in people who have a strong feeling for a soul .
they say who doesn &apos;t have soul that &apos;s dead and can &apos;t claim anything .
and here you are already feeling .
here comes this logic in this , yeah , in this dexed speech .
you see it immediately .
the first two sentences that make logically correct .
because i can say everything .
the logic doesn &apos;t make any signs about reality .
i can say the canzlerist is a man .
and if i have right , the canzler is a man .
if i &apos;m not right , the canzler is not a man .
logic doesn &apos;t make any excuse about what &apos;s going on .
i can claim it all .
but crucially , if i have right , it &apos;s just right .
so if clarks say there &apos;s no soul .
secondly , if he &apos;s right , he doesn &apos;t have soul .
these things make sense correct .
and now our default consciousness feels immediately , and you can do something about it .
it depends on a third sentence that doesn &apos;t have anything to do with the first two sentences , and it does as if the opposite of the first sentence has already proved .
because actually we have to prove whether there &apos;s the soul or not .
but with this logic that is easy to use that two sentences are logically correct , and a third related , it looks like it &apos;s going to do something about it , so we can save our lifestyles .
so , we do as if it &apos;s impossible to live without a soul .
and we &apos;re very happy about this .
we can continue these things on different examples .
in the present day , we have a whole modern example that fills the daily newspapers again .
so here you have another philosophical topic , a tragedy of philosophy , holding present .
that &apos;s what we do with it that we go back to the decades .
there were a scholarship , which was called johannes burigous , and after that &apos;s called the bubbles of the bubbles .
the burid side of the bubbles is a mix that &apos;s made out of pure nature .
it doesn &apos;t have that soul .
this is one of the main stances .
and if you place the exact same in the middle between two equal habitats , it increases .
because he doesn &apos;t know what the haystack should go first first .
so it &apos;s right in the middle .
that &apos;s how the curriculum presented .
the same level of forces with intentional signs resolve each other .
nothing happens at all .
so only when you bring another example , so if you immediately make a haystack bigger , you don &apos;t need any reason , it doesn &apos;t need any reason .
automatically , he &apos;s going to the right thought .
if you have this idea that you &apos;re kind of driven in nature , you &apos;re being determined by the larger pile that &apos;s going to give you immediately , you also have the feeling that there must be something like a free will .
and if we &apos;re in france here in france , i remember the max plan institute in brain science .
there &apos;s a scholarship , which is called wolf singers , and he says , you know , wolf trend , there is no freedom of freedom .
now , again , we can make the second sentence and say , if wolf singer is right , he doesn &apos;t have any freedom .
these sentences are absolutely logical and correct .
and what we can now read in the daypaper almost every day , which is what you find in this third sentence .
it looks something like this who doesn &apos;t have any freedom of freedom , can &apos;t be moved for its actions and claims for responsibility , and so it &apos;s unable to be accumulated .
again , they have it again .
in fact , first of all , you need to prove that there &apos;s something like welfare .
but the logic of deception allows us to do that as if the first sentence of president is wrong , as if you have to think of the opposite without evidence .
and now you can just say , if you want to do anything yourself , if you want to test anything for yourself , and especially if you want to make people happy to practice this courage .
for example , if you encounter one person , you can say , there are no predictions .
and please don &apos;t use the german word for predictability , which is called prophet .
you can &apos;t call it , that would be a little politically elegant again .
say , there are no predictions .
immediately you &apos;re going to get one , for example , for example , to experience some predictions , you can &apos;t prove that .
and they already have a problem .
because while you &apos;re busy trying to realize that you can &apos;t prove that there &apos;s no predictability , the guy is very happy .
he &apos;s very happy about this because he missed her .
because he led them on a riot that he doesn &apos;t hang on itself .
because actually , this person is not interested in evidence .
he &apos;s just interested in keeping themselves free before the need to prove that there are predictions .
so , in the kind of distribution of evidence , they &apos;re experiencing the greatness of lying .
and once you have an opportunity to feel this disaster in other people , you do it because you &apos;re going to make other happy , if you don &apos;t remember it in this way .
thank you for your attention .
yeah , good afternoon .
i allowed me to ask liberty if i could mention them .
she &apos;s one of the regulators here from this great event , and asked me if i gave a talk here and i gave my idea .
i have to say , you &apos;ve figured it out , i started talking hard about my idea .
and i may have imagined my island project to try and imagine .
but , of course , it &apos;s the sum , of course , a lot of ideas .
i &apos;m probably , you know , the two nice girls still , i &apos;m probably going to be the generation that &apos;s made for this bad ecosystem , because i &apos;ve started 9 hundred &apos; 70s studying machines , technical high school , today , i
and i went to berlin at the end of the eight-year-old berlin , because i wanted to make renewables , and they didn &apos;t have a car box .
there was the kitchen lab of leopold harbor .
then they were all the cure , but the jewish was called kah .
the hot up days today .
because a good engineer has either built great cars or nuclear power plants .
but it &apos;s like the u.n. solar center , which is sort of a hundred watts from the square meter , which was a toy .
and in berlin , there was a crazy engineering collective .
i &apos;m grateful to the premium coke man that he required the word again , because after the wall , you couldn &apos;t use the word , because everything left left was bad .
however , that was not like this in the 80s .
it was just that there were self-organizing old activities , and one of them was sitting in siberia in the envelope , where you suspected evil .
so , place of terrorist , but that was called moodronics and made wind and solar energy , and i started in the middle of the eight times .
and yes , a lot of what was said today , it touches me very , very , very much , many , many beautiful expressions that i &apos;ve been living through .
i worked for 11 years in the collective , which was harder .
we were 20 people .
if one no was told , beetgenis , which has completely painted a lot . i &apos;ve been treating it for 10 years , whether i could really do my great engineering study , because all the colleagues of my father have always suggested him
it engages with confidence .
and that was really , very , very bitter , and you also come in like this in the negotiation phase , and it graduated from a picture , where i asked me for 10 years , thousands of d.c. , right now ,
and i went down to sixth of six , and then we came together with friends in the company , and i became a commitment of the company of the company , which then became one of the greatest cells in the world .
so , of course , a big success story , but again , we have the problem of a growing company , and we &apos;ve got a small group , a small group , decided that we &apos;re going to start a little bit of the future , and
and i brought you through a project that i want you to imagine now .
and the title of the presentation was , you know , how to renew to 100 percent renewable .
and we just started asking with a relatively simple story , where you could use a memory of a memory today .
on this island , this is the island of grace .
yes , it &apos;s like that data .
there live four and a half thousand people .
they have a renewable energy share of 15 percent today .
and the question is , why don &apos;t they have more ?
it &apos;s not just technological .
if you build more wind power each other , the system starts to fail .
i also tell the politicians always when they were building our facilities in berlin-adulard .
they &apos;re always saying , why ?
we &apos;ve already got 20 percent in germany .
it can &apos;t be a problem .
but not , we have seven percent in europe , and our net is physically seen the european .
if we had 20 percent in europe , we would have the same problems that people have on this island .
the question was simple , calculating that was second 20066 , the first contacts in the island started , but just through it .
so how big it would have to be a battery so that you can make an island at 20 , 30 , 40 , 50 , maybe 700 percent renewable .
and yeah , i &apos;ll go again to a sbow again .
the conventional system looks like this all over the world .
by the way , about a hundred giant electrical performance will be built around the world , by a year .
that &apos;s the power of a hundred nuclear power stations , because it &apos;s very fast everywhere .
the energy traction of the world that &apos;s going to be wiped up with this lure , because you don &apos;t need to have a permission .
that &apos;s very quick .
you put it in the neck .
and then it usually looks like this .
so three of those are always waiting , two are always waiting .
yeah , this is what one of them looks like at the bottom is the load .
we also got very accurate data .
and the wind force or the solar force or whatever it is , usually a bang-up system is related to a system that can air up in small amounts here .
our goal was to say , okay .
this is going to bang , and the wind , the sun is using the load so that they can map the larger percentage .
and if you want to go over 20 , 30 percent renewables , energy per year , not the performance at the moment , you have to turn it out .
that means , at the moment , you have to make sure that renewables are somehow going to take over the entire web .
of course , you can only , in any way , be created in any way here .
no one &apos;s done this yet in the world .
it &apos;s in the little style , so you can also serve your lawyer on a little intervene .
people always ask me , what are you studying in the wall yard ?
that &apos;s what &apos;s happening .
but if you want to put multiple of these interfaces together , and you want to build a network , it becomes extremely complicated .
and our goal was that we wanted to get up to 70 to 50 percent renewable , and then there &apos;s this rest of the rest , the last 10 , 20 percent renewable , which becomes very , very expensive , and it &apos;s not going
it &apos;s definitely going to be a energy car that then , hydrogen , methane , power to gas , you know , it will be it .
you &apos;ve got to go to a seasonal store and winter summer and not only day night .
we just wanted to know , what about a normal , controversial chemical battery ?
so how far do you get there at all ?
and then they put a whole bunch of simulation .
and the wind and the sun and the sun simulated , and they came up with the result , a very exciting result , that , after 20 years , you need a middle price price of about 50 cents per kilogram , about four cents
these were the first calculations six years ago .
and then we said , okay .
it &apos;s great , then we have a business model .
we &apos;re cheaper like the solar system , when it rises five percent per year .
and then we started to negotiate with the incentives .
what had to be done ?
they &apos;ve negotiated with investors ; i &apos;ve looked at new walks .
we were only five people at the time to rebuild one .
and here &apos;s the show .
the brown is kind of the conventional system , the green is our system .
that our system also has a prosthetic system , because we &apos;re still doing 20 percent of the time , and there &apos;s a price attack on the other things .
and the power suil , which is the electrotentially supply business on the island , we think that &apos;s a great thing .
let &apos;s also support , but we don &apos;t believe you can solve the technical problem .
and so we &apos;ve decided to build a hall in berlin , where we can kind of map the electrical ratio of the island at one to three very accurately .
that means we &apos;ve first looked to find the biggest battery in the world .
here she is .
it comes from asia , in the case of japan .
and funnyly , in the &apos; 70s , it &apos;s been developed at bbc manufacturer , today , and it was developed , and then it turned out to the japanese .
you can see , it &apos;s a very , very big battery .
she has a megawatts of performance , and she can bring that performance for six hours , and that &apos;s the battery that we &apos;ve kind of got simulation .
and then they put them up .
we also have one of these gay aggregates in the same size , as he &apos;s standing in the halls , in fact , in fact , the full dynamic behavior of this net , so in the hall , it looks like this , there
over here , we simulate the entire transmission system , the kilometer of the wires , to make the vibration in the net .
and here you can see the whole thing .
we can also switch two hundred kilowatts of photographs on the net .
here &apos;s what we see here again , again , the whole , single aggregate .
and what we did is , since second thousand , the hall was finished , until today &apos;s second 12-year-old , almost everything that was here between the individual system of electronics , we did .
so we &apos;re not a bacterium , but we define us as a company that is only between the top battery and the topic of the web , and everything between it .
you have to , of course , communicate to the battery , you must also communicate to the web , and it &apos;s very complicated .
the beautiful thing is that in this island , it &apos;s basically all that you can take advantage of the problems that we &apos;re going to get , if we want to increase our percentage of renewables .
so this whole discussion , how is going to move right now and move , energy , how to go , for example , on the island , for example , we have for five-percent depths of oxygen , so we blow the wind and the
so lightlight is then providing smart flu .
so text flu , a huge issue everywhere .
we can start to integrate electromomobility on the island at the time that we can integrate , we can do the lake manufacturing .
that means when you &apos;re 70 percent renewable , you can &apos;t do that without memory .
you can do it by the nasty flu , you can get out of the nets , yes , so that &apos;s what you should be doing in any case , but you &apos;re never going to be able to conclude for memory completely .
and that &apos;s so little the message .
so many people come and look at this , because you can see what problems you get .
if we turn that line off , you just don &apos;t have this rotating mass that causes a certain inertia in the net .
and our european gridlock is basically just rotating romantic masses of large power stations where the wave all over europe is shining .
we look in this net , and we see the fifth hero , and if it gets nine and a half commodities nine heroes nine heroes , we &apos;re going to get a few valves , and then again , a little bit of a
that &apos;s the system .
and of course , it &apos;s incredibly teert .
if you cut that somewhere down , it &apos;s going to take it for a while .
the spirit reserved has at least 10 seconds to keep the net stable .
and at the time , they can react again .
if you don &apos;t have that anymore , this rotating mass , you have to replace that with empathy and electrochem .
and we can switch on this big battery two millennia once .
and you can see what enormous speed possibilities there are .
and the message is now , we have to combine on these rotating masses , if we like our goals 20 , 20 , 20 percent , 30 , 30 percent , and so on , if we want to do it at all .
then we have to rebuild our mstra circle of capacity in the net .
mst-road is simple , the power station runs to keep the frequency .
yes , it &apos;s a huge bag at the moment , building from the coal power , because we don &apos;t , or we can &apos;t do it , because that &apos;s not going on .
and we &apos;re just trying to realize that you can rebuild the capacity that can rebuild mri-circles , by bringing electrochemical memory into the net .
now , fortunately , there are a lot of studies now .
and that &apos;s the purpose of the people coming and looking at our trial on this , sort of our island plan .
and yes , the discussion is always about the question of how far there can be a piece of far future there .
and a lot of discussions that i had in the last six years were similar to the discussion that i had in the last 30 years to have the psychologist .
don &apos;t go , it &apos;s unconscious , children &apos;s game players , we &apos;ve never talked about anything .
we have three of the gifts of photo certificates today in germany .
that &apos;s a great thing .
and i &apos;m just going out that we &apos;re going to have the same capacity of electchemical memory in the next 30 years around the world .
it &apos;s very simple , that &apos;s how it &apos;s going to come .
there &apos;s going to be such a lot of resilience and arguments .
the beautiful thing is that i &apos;ve been seeing in the last two years , the scientists are going to go to my side .
we have now gotten over 10 million procedures , also , to go to the negotiation of 10 megawatts now to the german web .
this is going to happen in the next april .
so , by the way , there &apos;s a change there , and it &apos;s just about this distinction , to the idea , a hundred percent renewable right now .
and if you have a hundred percent renewable , it &apos;s like a autistic system .
in discussions , they &apos;re always trying to do this , they &apos;re going to do the automobile , they have a little bit of the web , and they don &apos;t have anything to do with our bandwidth .
the question is very simple , if you &apos;re completely independent of any fossil or urban energy crops that will be driven somewhere in the world and being brought to them , you &apos;re an island .
then they only use what &apos;s going on in the sun and the wind , where they live .
and this is a little bit of our vision of an infinite energy supply , and i &apos;m also grateful that they &apos;re also grateful to use solar energy .
and that &apos;s what we do , and that &apos;s what we &apos;re doing , even the lecture of premium , that you can be a collective , and use solar energy , here &apos;s a little bit together .
and yeah , i just want to encourage you , in the sense that you can be a little crazy and have a vision .
and you really have to stay quite close , but i think it &apos;s going to happen .
thank you .
when steve lopez , columbia the los angeles times , one day through the streets of los angeles , he heard a wonderful music .
she came from a man , an african-american , sympathetic , rough , homeless , who played on a violin that had only two sheets .
many of you will know the story , because from stves article about this later , a book is later sent , with robert downey junior , as steve lopex and jamie foxx , as the contrary of the juilliard
nathaniel left juilliard , created a nerve breakdown , and 30 years later he lived as a homeless on the streets of los angeles .
i recommend to read all of you , steven book , or look at the movie so that you can &apos;t just understand the wonderful connection between these two men , but also how the music complained that connection , and how it used to be
i met mr. eggs in 2008 , two years ago , at the walt disney concent hall .
he just heard an introduction of beethoven &apos;s first and fourth singing and came behind the stage to imagine .
he was talking in a very hotter and pleasant sound about yo-yo ma and hillary clinton and about how dodgers would never make it into the baseball world service , and all of this because of the historic passage of beethoven
we came to speak music , and a couple of days later , i got an email that said that nathaniel was interested in what i was interested in .
i still have to mention that nathaniel required a medical treatment , because he had already been treated with electric shocks and thread and hands , a trauma that has been tracking him his entire life .
now , as a result of that , it &apos;s particularly vulnerable to these schizophrenic phases , and they &apos;re sometimes so bad , and it disappears in the streets of the city row , always that horror and the torture
and in the same such as a distant stage , nathaniel was , when we first started with our first class , disney , the walt disney conclusion started hall , and he had lost this irressed flacker in his eyes
he talked about invisible demons and smoke and about how someone in the sleep wanted to poison in the sleep .
i was scared , not mine , but i was afraid that i could lose it in one condition , and i could destroy him his relationship to the violin , when i started talking about showers and aristocracy and other exciting forms of
so i just started playing .
i played the first sentence of beethoven &apos;s vietnamese .
and as i was playing , i realized that in naked moments , there was a complete change .
it was like he was under the influence of an invisible drug , a chemical reaction , whose catalyst is my game .
naked manufacturers turned into understanding , in a calm curiosity and vulnerability .
and like a miracle he took his violin , and he started playing a few clips of vilinine , and then asked me to end it : cold son , stamiform , siberia .
so we started talking about music , starting from bachls on beethoven , bradles , battery and all the other guys , from cartok to the wall of the switzerland .
and i realized that he wasn &apos;t just an encyclopedia knowledge about music , but it was also a very close personal relationship with her .
he talked about her with a passion and a understanding that i just knew about my colleagues in the philharmonic of los angeles .
by playing music and talking about music , from this parachute , confused man , who had been moved through the streets of los angeles , a lovely , educated , extended musician , in juilliard trained musicians .
music is medicine . music changes us .
for nathaniel , music is seal health .
because the music allows him to transform his thoughts and delusions with the help of his imagination and creativity in something real .
and so he goes out of his original states .
i understood that this is exactly the nature of art .
this is why we make music : we can make something that is deeply in all of us , deeply inside of us , our emotions , through our artistic lens , through our creativity to reality .
and the reality of that expression makes us all , and is moving , inspired and united of us .
what nathaniel did was he brought him back into a community of friends .
the steady power of music brought him back to a family of musicians who recognized him who recognized his talent and was paying him .
and i &apos;m always going to play with nathaniel music , whether the walt disney contributed hall or in skoe row , because he reminds me why i became musicians .
thank you .
bruno giusji : thank you . thank you .
robert gupta .
robert gupta : i want to play a little bit that i would be in disruption of the curves .
i hope you forgive me .
so i &apos;ve known a lot of fish in my life .
i only loved two .
this first one was more like a passionate afghan .
it was a beautiful fish , well-known , good consistency , fulfilling , a degradation on the psycho .
what a fish .
even better , he was raised in a lot of the highest standards of sustainability .
so you could feel like you were going to sell him .
i had a relationship with this beauty for several months .
and one day the head of the company called and asked if i could speak at a event about the sustainability of the farm .
&quot; of course , &quot; i said .
here was a company trying to solve what has become this unimaginable problem for our chef , and how do we keep fish on our maps ?
over the last 50 years , we &apos;ve flashed the oceans as we were beating forests .
it &apos;s hard to extend destruction .
90 percent of the big fish that we love , the tunas , the heating , the lax , the lax , they &apos;re collapsed .
it &apos;s almost nothing left .
so , perhaps or bad piquza , fishing , part of our future is going to be part of our future .
a lot of arguments against that . fisheries pollute the environment , most of them , and they are inefficient , we take tuna . a big disadvantage .
he &apos;s got food value from 15 to one .
that means 15 pounds of wild is needed to get a pound of lung tuna .
not very sustainable .
it doesn &apos;t taste very well .
so finally , here was a company trying to do it right .
i wanted to support them .
the day before the event , i called the head of public work for the company .
let &apos;s call it doon .
&quot; don don &apos;t , &quot; i said , &quot; just to have the facts right , you &apos;re famous for building so far out in the ocean that you don &apos;t blow the environment . &quot;
&quot; that &apos;s true , &quot; he said . &quot; we are so far out that the waste is distributed from our fish , not concentrated . &quot;
and then he added , &quot; we &apos;re basically a world .
it said 2.5 to 1 , &quot; he said .
&quot; the best in the industry . &quot;
2.5 to one , great .
&quot; 2.5 to one what ? what feeds you ? &quot;
&quot; sustainable protein , &quot; he said .
&quot; great , &quot; i said .
and at that night , i was standing in bed thinking , what the hell is a sustainable protein ?
so the next day i called , just before the event , don &apos;t .
i said , &quot; don don &apos;t , what are sustainable proteins for ? &quot;
he said he didn &apos;t know . he &apos;s going to ask .
well , i was working with a couple of people in the company . nobody could give me a clear answer , until i finally refused with the remote biologist .
let &apos;s call it don &apos;t do it .
&quot; don don &apos;t , &quot; i said , &quot; what are sustainable proteins ? &quot;
well , he mentioned some algae and some fisheries , and then he said chicken packs .
i said , &quot; chicken packets ? &quot;
he said , &quot; yes , feathers , skin , bone flour , rescue , drip and feed . &quot;
i said , &quot; how much percent of your fet is chicken ? &quot;
that may by maybe two percent .
&quot; well , that &apos;s about 30 percent , &quot; he said .
i said , &quot; don don &apos;t , what &apos;s sustainable about feeding chicken in fish ? &quot;
there was a long pause in the exercise , and he said , &quot; there &apos;s too much chicken in the world . &quot;
i fell in love with this fish .
no , not because i &apos;m a selfish genius and a good person .
i even am .
no , i actually loved me from this fish because , i swear to god , the fish packed into chicken after this conversation .
this second fish , that &apos;s another kind of love story .
it &apos;s the romantic way , the way that you know the better you know your fish , you love the fish more .
i was eating him in a restaurant first in southern asia .
a friend of journalist had talked for a long time about this fish .
she kind of doubled us .
he came on the table with a bright , very slighting white color .
the coch had bosen him .
just stop twice .
it was still delicious . it still was delicious .
who can taste a fish so well after he got cooked ?
i can &apos;t , but this guy can do it .
let &apos;s call it miguel . in fact , he &apos;s called miell .
and no , he didn &apos;t cook the fish , and he &apos;s not a chef . at least in the way that they and i understand .
he &apos;s a biologist at van la palm .
this is a fish in the southwest corner spain .
it &apos;s near the mountain total of the river guanqual .
until the 1980s , the farm was in the hands of argentina .
they raised meat cattle on what was basically the dressed areas .
they did it by starving the country .
they built this complicated sequence of channels , and they pulled water out of the country and out into the river .
well , they couldn &apos;t make that work , not economic .
and ecologically , it was a disaster .
it brought about 90 percent of the birds around the place , which is a lot of birds .
and so in 1982 , a spanish company bought the country .
what did they do ?
they have vice versa about the flow of water .
they literally started the lever .
instead of sequencing the water , they used the channels to get the water back .
they flared the channels .
they created a 11,000 hectares of fish -- bosch , sea ice , shrimp , aal -- and in fact , mriel and his company has completely vice versa of ecological destruction .
the farm is incredible .
i mean , you &apos;ve never seen anything like this .
they stare out on the horizon , which is a million miles away , and all you see is flutes of shifts and that dense march .
i wasn &apos;t there a long time ago with mriel .
he &apos;s an incredible guy , three parts of charles darwin and part of &quot; a crocodile . &quot;
okay ? there we were , and struggling us through the wetlands , and i meet and sweet , i have mao to my knees , and miguel is holding a class .
here he &apos;s going to pick up a rare glorious .
now he mentioned the minerals needs of phytoplankton .
and here , here is a pattern of concentration that reminds him to the tanzanic giraffe .
it turns out that mriel spent most of his career in the mumb national park in africa .
i asked him how he became such a fish engineer .
he said , &quot; fish ? i don &apos;t know about fish .
i &apos;m an expert for relationships . &quot;
and then it goes and it falls into more talks of rare birds and algae and weird water plants .
and don &apos;t get me wrong , that was really fascinating , you know , the biofuel community buried in the way .
it &apos;s great , but i was in love .
and my head became weak about this conventional piece of little fish that i had on the night .
so i interrupted him . i said , &quot; miral , how does your fish taste so well ? &quot;
he showed his algae .
&quot; i know boy , the algae , the phytoplankton , the relationships , that &apos;s incredible .
but what eating your fish ?
what is food value ? &quot;
well , he continues to tell me that it &apos;s such a rich system that the fish eat what they would eat in the wild .
the vegetable biomass , the phytoplankton , the zoo plankton , that &apos;s what fish feed .
the system is so healthy , it &apos;s completely self-estefficient .
there is no food .
anybody from a farm hear that their animals don &apos;t feed ?
later , i went around on this site with miguel , and i asked him , i said , &quot; for a place which seems so natural , &quot; different than any farm i &apos;ve ever been , &quot; how do you measure success ? &quot;
at that moment , it was like a film director would have asked a brevuse .
and we bow around the corner , and we had the most incredible view , thousands and thousands of pinkers of fluid , a literally pinker carpet so far .
&quot; that &apos;s succeeding , &quot; he said .
&quot; look at your rooms , pink .
they &apos;re drawing . &quot;
dragging ? i was completely confused .
i said , &quot; miral , don &apos;t pap your fish ? &quot;
and he said , &quot; yes . &quot;
&quot; we lose 20 percent of our fish and fish fish on the birds .
well last year on this site was 600,000 birds , more than 250 different species .
it &apos;s now the biggest , and one of the most important private avressed reserves all over europe .
i said , &quot; mriel , is a good thrilled bird tape not the last thing you want to have on a fish ? &quot;
he was shaking his head , no .
he said , &quot; we &apos;re building extinct , not intense .
this is an ecological network .
the fluid eats the shrimp .
the shrimp eats the phytoplankton .
so the pinker , the better the system . &quot;
okay , let &apos;s think about this . a farm that doesn &apos;t feed their animals and a farm that measures their success at the health of their predators .
a fish , but also a bird reserve .
oh , and by the way , these fluidos should not even be there .
they breed 240 kilometers in a city where the stock market is better for nest maintenance workers .
they fly 240 miles to the farm every morning .
and every night it &apos;s going to fly 240 miles .
they do it because they can follow the stealing white line of the landroad of a country .
seriously .
i showed myself a kind of journey of penguins , so i looked at miel .
i said , &quot; mirael , fly it 240 miles to the farm and fly it 240 miles at the night ?
do you do that for your children ? &quot;
he looked at me as though i was quoting a song of whitney houston .
he said , &quot; no . you do that because the food is better . &quot;
i didn &apos;t mention the skin of my loved fish that was delicious , and i don &apos;t like fish skins . i don &apos;t like to clean them up . i don &apos;t like it but not to .
it &apos;s this kind , hungry taste .
i almost never cook with it .
and yet , when i tried them in the restaurant in the south spain , she didn &apos;t paint for fish at all .
she liked sweet and clean as if one would take a sue from the ocean .
i mentioned this against migel and he nickly .
he said , &quot; the skin runs like a sponge .
she &apos;s the last disappear before something in the body occurs .
it has evolved throughout evolution to reach unregards . &quot;
and then he added , &quot; but our water has no units . &quot;
okay . a farm that doesn &apos;t feed your fish . a farm that measures your success on the success of your predators .
and then i realized , if he says a farm that has no units , he fuels enormous , because the water that flows through this farm comes from the river of guandal .
it &apos;s a river that leads all of the things that rivers are now tending to lead them , chemical pollutants , abundance of pestest .
and if it &apos;s fought through the system , and that leaves the water , it &apos;s cleaner than how it got .
the system is so healthy , it cleans the water .
so not just a farm that feeds their animals , not just a farm that measures their success at the health of their predators , but a farm that &apos;s literally a water paradigm , not just for you and me and me .
because when the water flows down , it &apos;s in the atlantic .
a drop in the ocean , i know , but i &apos;ll take it , and you should do that , because this love story , like romantic , is also concentrated .
you could say she &apos;s a recipe for the future of good food , whether we &apos;re talking about bosch or meat .
what we need now is a radical new concept of agriculture , from one , in which food actually tastes well .
but it &apos;s a little bit too radical for many people .
we are not realists , we are geniuses . we &apos;re lovely .
we love weeks markets . we love small family operations . we talk about local food . we &apos;re eating organic food .
and if you claim that these are the things that the future of good food represents , somebody &apos;s up there and says , &quot; hey guys , i love pink fluid , but how are you going to feed the world ?
how will they feed the world ? &quot;
may i be honest ?
i don &apos;t like that question .
no , not because we &apos;re producing enough calories to feed the world more than just .
a billion people are hungry today .
one billion -- that &apos;s more than ever before -- in the distribution of inequality in distribution , not the full production .
well , i don &apos;t like this question because she has determined the logic of our food systems for the last 50 years .
feeder crops of plants , penguins of monkeys , chemicals on the earth , chicken of fish , and all the time the agricultural industry just asks : &quot; if we feed more people cheaper , how terrible can that be ? &quot;
that was the move . it was the rapid . it was the business plan of american agriculture .
we should call them what it is , a package in abundance , a performance that &apos;s rapidly attached ecological capital that enables that production .
this is not a commercial , and it &apos;s not agriculture .
our grain of corporation is threatened today , not due to the end , but because of driving resources .
not by the latest mines and tractor inventions , but by fertile land , not through pumps , but through fresh water , not by chairs , but by forests , and not by fishing and nets , but by fish in
they want to feed the world ?
let &apos;s start with the question : how are we going to feed ourselves ?
or better , how can we create conditions that enable each community to feed themselves ?
and to do that , don &apos;t look at the agricultural model for the future .
it &apos;s really old , and it &apos;s done .
capital , chemistry and machines are up there , and it never made something really good for food .
instead , let &apos;s look at the ecological model .
this is this taking back on two billion years of work .
look at miell , farmers like mriel .
in fact , businesses that are not worlds for themselves , businesses that relate to retirement , operations , to grow extinct , instead of only intensive , farmers who are not only complained , but experts for relationships .
because they are the ones who are also experts for taste .
and if i &apos;m really honest , you &apos;re a better coch than i will ever be .
you know , that &apos;s right , because if that &apos;s the future of good food , it will be delicious .
thank you .
if i want to get to you today one thing is that the total data that we consume is bigger than the sum of their parts , and instead of thinking about information transportation , i want you to think about how we can use information to
so what we &apos;re seeing here is a typical demographic to the age of age .
the program that i use here is a little experiment .
it &apos;s called piano and what i can do with piano is that i can filter after a certain death , we say accidents .
and immediately i see another pattern that makes it .
and this is because the middle class here is the most active people and you are over here at the most vulnerable .
and we can take a step further , and we &apos;ll take the data further and see that circuits and cancer are the usual suspects , but not for everybody .
now , if we go on and we can apply to age , we say 40 years or younger , we see that accidents are even the main cause that people should be worried about .
and who &apos;s trying to see that this is particularly true to men .
so you can see that looking at information and data , in this way , is reminded in a living information graph .
and if we can make this for raw data , why not for content itself ?
what we have here is the titles of every single sports illustration , which has ever been printed .
it &apos;s all here . it &apos;s all online .
you can test it for my talk in your sales .
you can dive in a decade with piano .
you can dive in for a particular year .
you can jump directly to a certain copy .
now , if i look here , i see the athletes coming in this copy and the sports species .
i &apos;m a lance armstrong fan , so i click here with all of my spending where lance armstrong is mentioned .
now , if i want to get a bigger view , i could think , &quot; ok , what if i look at everything with the topic of bike ? &quot;
so i &apos;m going to step back and further the perspective .
now i see greg lemoon .
and so you get an idea that if you look at this kind of information , you can zoom in on this kind of information , battery , wider , zooming out , you don &apos;t look , or you don &apos;t just look .
you make something that is a little bit different .
it &apos;s something in between , and we think it changes the way information can be used .
so i want to take this idea a little bit further with something a little bit crazy .
what we &apos;ve done here is we took every single wikipedia and reduced it to a small summary .
the summary contains a short overview and a symbol of the area that comes out of it .
i just show the top 500 of the popular wikipedia .
but even in this limited view , we can do a lot of things .
immediately , we get an impression about the topics that are on wikipedia on wikipedia .
i &apos;m going to choose the government issue now .
now , after i chose &quot; government , &quot; i realize that wikipedia , which is most of the time to detect time magazine , &quot; people of the year . &quot;
this is really important because this is an insight that &apos;s not in one single wikipedia .
that &apos;s just to see when you go back and look at it .
so , looking at a certain of these summaries , i can then go into the subject of time magazine , &quot; people of the year , &quot; and see all together .
now , if i look at all of these people , i realize that the majority of the government government are , some come from science . some , even less , come out of the economy . here &apos;s my boss . and one comes from the
and interestingly , bono is also a ted prize winner .
so we can jump and look at all ted prize winners .
you can see , we surf the first time that it &apos;s really a net , not just from page to page , but much more abstract .
and so i want to show you what a little surprise could be .
i &apos;m just going to show you the new york times website .
piano , this application -- i don &apos;t want to call it a browser ; it &apos;s really not a browser , but you can look at websites with it -- and we bring this zoo technology to every single website like this .
so i can go back to a step , and i can jump right to a specific section .
this is important because you &apos;re only looking through looking at websites in this way that can look at the whole internet process in the same way .
so i can zoom in my travels in a certain time framework .
here &apos;s the state of the entire demonstration i &apos;ve been holding up here .
and i can go back to anything i &apos;ve seen today , again .
and again , when i go out and look at everything , i may be able to release my course after my searches , and here , i went to neural , and i went to the neural , right here , or here after live
and from here i can go into the side and call them back again .
it &apos;s a metaphor that &apos;s always used again , and every time it makes the entire picture bigger than the sum of data .
right now , in this world , we think that data is a scarcity .
we &apos;re talking about the rise of information surplus .
we &apos;re talking from drowning in information .
what if we could turn this situation and put the internet on your head , so that instead of going from one to another , we can start to go from many things to many things , and see patterns that were otherwise buried ?
if we can do this , then this long-term datapase , perhaps a new source of meaningful information .
and instead of just moving in information , we can get knowledge out of it .
and if we know knowledge , maybe we can even make wisdom out of it .
that &apos;s what i hear . thank you very much .
i grew up with a company of science fiction .
in my school time , i went to school every day , every day an hour .
and my nose always took a book in a book , a science fiction book that made my thoughts in other worlds , and in a friendly way my deep in me , satisfied voracious curiosity .
this curiosity also showed that i was whenever i wasn &apos;t in school , went through the forests of existing and &quot; samples &quot; , frogs and snakes and beetles , and put everything home home and looked under the microscope .
i was completely devastated , you know .
it was always about trying to understand the world and extending the boundaries of the possible .
and my love in science fiction seemed to reflect in my environment , because at the time , in the late &apos; 60s , we went to the moon and explored the deep sea .
jacques coust came into our living rooms with his fascinating shows that were showing us animals and places and a world full of miracles that we could never have imagined before .
so that &apos;s really good at that science fiction .
and i was artists .
i could draw . i could paint .
and since there was no video games , even this transition with computer-class movies still gave me the entire imagery in the media landscape , i had to create the images in my head .
that &apos;s what we had to do . if we read a book as children , we took the description of the author and projected them onto the canvas in our heads .
my response to that was drawing and paintings of aliens , aliens worlds , robots , spacecraft and all that stuff .
in math class , i was always caught by the teacher , and i was hiding behind the teacher , hiding behind the textbook .
creativity had to somehow get out of it .
and something interesting happened . what was fascinating to me about jacques cooked shows was the thought of a very unknown world here on our planet itself .
certainly i would never reach an alien world with a spaceship , and it seemed pretty unlikely to me .
but here was a world that i could actually enter , here on earth , and she was as fascinating and exotic as all i had imagined when i read these books .
so when i was 15 , i decided to be diver .
the only problem was that i lived in a small village in canada , 1,000 miles away from the next ocean .
but i didn &apos;t leave it out .
i wrote my father until he finally had a graduate school in buffalo , new york , just on the other side of the border where we lived .
i made my way in a pool of the mirror in buffalo in buffalo , new york .
but the ocean , a real ocean , i only got two years later when we moved to california .
since then , in the 40 years that went out now , i spent about 3,000 hours underwater , 500 hours of this .
and i learned that the world of the deep sea , even in the flourishing oceans , is so rich in fascinating lives , as we can really imagine it .
the imagination of nature doesn &apos;t know boundaries , especially in contrast to our own , mismatch human imagination .
until today , i feel deepest assumptions for what i see on my diagrams .
and my love is on the ocean with the same intensity as it is .
when i looked at a career as a profession , it was the movies .
this seemed the best opportunity to get my inner to tell stories , with my need to unite images .
i always drew comic books and something like that as a kid .
so films were the way to bring pictures and stories together , and they collapsed together .
of course , the stories i looked at , from the science fiction , was &quot; terminator , &quot; &quot; aliens , &quot; and &quot; abundance . &quot;
in &quot; aby , &quot; i could combine my preference for the underwater world and the dive of the films .
so basically my two passions .
something interesting happened at &quot; aby . &quot; to solve a narratoric problem in this movie -- and that &apos;s what we had to create kind of liquid water beings -- we &apos;re unaware of computing animation , cong , back .
what came out of this was the first computer-generated suggestion , which was ever in a movie .
so , the film didn &apos;t have any money , in fact , he just played his production cost , but i noticed something fascinating : the audience all around the world was in the magic of the magic that went out of it .
according to arthur clarke &apos;s law , we may have continued to distinguish technology and magic .
so they looked at something magical .
and i found that incredibly exciting .
and i was like , &quot; wow , it &apos;s got to be involved in the movie art . &quot;
so we went to &quot; terminator 2 , &quot; my next film , far further .
together with a file , we made the guy out of liquid metal . the success was very much about how this effect would come from .
and it worked . again , we did something magical , and the effect in the audience was the same thing , but we &apos;ve been playing a little more money with the movie .
of these two experiences , a whole new world was achieved , a whole new world of creativity for film design .
so i started a company with my good friend stan witt , who was the best make-up and cure designer , and it was called digital domain .
so the basic idea of this company was to jump the phase analytics with visual printers and to start with digital production .
so we did that , and we made a competitive advantage for that for a while .
but in the middle of the &apos; 90s , we realized that we were in the cure and charstatel design -- what we actually found the company , which was too slow .
i wrote this piece of &quot; avatar , &quot; which should give the measure of visual effects and computer-generated effects in a whole new altitude , with realistic human , remarkable characters that were made by cg , and the main characters should all
but the measure of the measure was pretty much back . and the people in my company told me that we shouldn &apos;t be able to do that .
so i took this and made this other film about the big ship that goes down .
so the movie studio i sold as a &quot; romeo and juliet on a ship , &quot; became a lovely film , a passionate film .
but in my mind , i really wanted to turn down to the real crack of the titanic .
so i made the movie .
that &apos;s the truth . the studio didn &apos;t know it .
but i convinced them , by saying , &quot; we &apos;re going to the wrack . we &apos;re filming the real crack .
we &apos;re going to show it in the opening of the movie .
it &apos;s incredibly important . it &apos;s a good follower for marketing . &quot;
and i told them to fund an expedition .
sounds crazy . but that again goes back that your imagination can make reality .
and we actually made six months later a reality where i found myself in a russian dive , four kilometers below the surface of the north atlantic , looking at the real titanic through a bulleye .
this wasn &apos;t a movie , no technology , that was real .
so , that really stuck me up .
and preparation was enormous . we had to build cameras and respects and all kinds of things .
and i noticed how much these deep season , space mission looked like .
well , they were also hooked , and they took more sophisticated planning .
you go into this capsule , you go down into these dark , hostile environment , where no hope is on rescue , if you don &apos;t make it back .
and i thought , &quot; wow , that &apos;s just like i &apos;m in a science fiction movie .
that &apos;s really cool . &quot;
i was quite obsessed with studying the deep sea .
anyway , from the part that has to do with curiosity and science , it was all . it was adventure , it was curiosity . it was imagination .
and it was an experience that hollywood couldn &apos;t give me .
because , you know , i could imagine a creature for which we could then design a visual effect , but i couldn &apos;t imagine what i would see outside of the window .
in some of the following expeditions , i &apos;ve seen creatures in thertherther , and sometimes things that i &apos;ve never seen before , sometimes things that no one had ever seen before , and for the science at the time we saw them , had never
so that got me right , and i wanted more .
and so i met a slightly unusual decision .
after the success of titanic , i said to myself , &quot; okay , i want to leave my profession as a filmmaker in hollywood and become full-time researchers for a while . &quot;
and then we started , we started to go and study them with robots of robots .
we removed to the titanic of titanic .
we took little robots that we had built to break up a fiber bubble .
our intention was to dive in and look at the inside of the ship , which had never been done before .
no one had ever explored the inside of the wall . you didn &apos;t have any resources for that . so we developed the technology .
so , there i am , on the demonstration of the titanic , in a dive , and see that these brakes are quite similar to this , and i know that once the band was playing there .
and i fly with a little robots of the ship through the songs of the ship .
it &apos;s actually just working , but my consciousness is within the vehicle .
it felt like i was holding physically within the ship rock of titanic .
and this was the scheduled form of a maljjah vu that i &apos;ve ever experienced , because before i go around one corner , i always knew what was going on in the light side of the vehicle , because i was running on the
because the set was an accurate copy of the ship &apos;s building plans .
so that was a very strange experience .
and she made me realize this telepresence of experience that you use such robotic avatar , and you use your own consciousness in the vehicle , in this other form of existence .
it was truly incredibly profound .
and maybe a little bit of a look at what might happen in a few decades when you have cybercriminals to explore something or do other things , in all sorts of poststyle future factories that i can imagine as science fiction .
after these expeditions , we started to learn what we were seeing down there , really appreciating these deep sources , where we saw these incredibly amazing animals -- these are sort of aliens , but here on earth .
they live with chemical help .
they don &apos;t exist in sunlight based on how we do that .
and so you see animals right next to 500 degrees centigrade that they can survive there .
at the same time , i was also very interested in space science , which was again the science fiction of my childhood .
and so i ended up with the people who are interested in space and having the nasa , sitting in the nasa references and planning right space emissions . they go to russia , through the mission of mission the biomedical protocols
that was fascinating .
but at the end of the day , i ended up taking space scientists with us into the deep sea .
i took them up , and i gave them access to the world down there : astronomers , planets , people interested in these extreme situations , and i took them to the sources so they could take samples and test instruments and so on
we were doing documentary , but we were actually doing science , and we were actually doing science .
so the circle between my existence as science fiction , as a child , and the implementation into reality .
and in the course of this discovery journey , i learned a lot .
i &apos;ve learned a lot about science , but i &apos;m sure you have to think a director needs to be a leader like a ship captain or something like that .
i didn &apos;t understand much of leadership before i ran these expeditions .
because at some point , i had to say , &quot; what do i do here ?
why am i doing that ? what comes out of it ? &quot;
these dumb films don &apos;t give us money .
we &apos;re just playing the production cost . it &apos;s not a curve .
everybody think i went from &quot; titanic &quot; and &quot; avatar , &quot; and i would have given the nails somewhere on a toilet on a beach .
i have all these movies , these documents , for a very small audience .
no fake , no honor , no money . what are you doing ?
you &apos;re willing to do it for the task , to want the challenge -- and the ocean is the most challenging environment that exists . you do it by discovery , and because of the strange connection that comes when a small group of people form a
because we did all of this with only 10 to 12 people that have been collapsing for years , and sometimes we were two to three months back to sea .
and in this community , you realize that the most important thing is the accomplishment that you have in front of each other because you have a problem that you can explain to someone else .
when you go back to land and say , &quot; we had to do it , the fablas , the communication , the whole thing , and the difficulty , the human empowerment , if you &apos;re working on lake , you can &apos;t explain the
there &apos;s a connection that comes together , one individual respect .
so when i came back to turn my next movie &quot; avatar , &quot; i tried to apply the same leadership , which is that you respect your team and make it respectful in your respect .
so the dynamics were really changed .
so there i was again with a small team in unknown terrain , and we made &quot; avatar , &quot; with a new technology that didn &apos;t exist before .
extremely exciting .
a tremendous challenge .
and we became a real family for four and a half years .
and that changed my way of making films completely .
there were people who thought we had this ocean really good , and we were transporting the planet pandora .
for me , it was a fundamental way of doing my job , the actual process that has changed in the outcome .
so what can we conclude from all of this ?
what lessons did we learn ?
i think that first is curiosity .
it &apos;s the most powerful human feature .
our imagination is a force that even can make reality .
and the accomplishment of your team is more important than all of the world &apos;s most unprecedented .
to me , young filmmakers who say , &quot; give me a advice , how i can do this . &quot;
and i say , &quot; don &apos;t scare yourself .
that &apos;s what other people get for you . don &apos;t do it yourself , don &apos;t bet against yourself . you take risks on you . &quot;
nasa has such a favorite thing : &quot; failure is not an alternative . &quot;
but in art and exploration , failures have to be an alternative , because there &apos;s a contradiction .
not an important undercatch innovation has ever been given without risk .
you have to be willing to take these risks .
that &apos;s the idea that i &apos;d like to give you on the way . failure is an alternative , fear , but it &apos;s not . thank you .
today i &apos;m talking to you about energy and climate .
and this may surprise something because my full employees at the foundation are mainly transformed by vaccines and seeds to have the things that we have to invent and deliver to the poorest 2 billion a better life .
but energy and climate is extremely important to these people , even more important than any other on the planet .
climate change means that their secrets are not going to grow over many years , and we &apos;re going too much or less , and things will change as they can &apos;t keep their features out of environment .
that leads to hunting . it leads to uncertainty . it leads to crux .
so , climate change will be terrible for them .
and also , the energy price is very important for them .
in fact , if you could only reduce the price of the price , the poverty decrease , it would be much more effective .
well , the energy price has fallen over time .
in fact , the progress society is based on energy progress .
the oyster revolution took the industrial revolution , and even in the 20th century , there was a rapid case in electrotentially , and that &apos;s why we have refrigerators , air foods , we can make modern materials and do so many things
so we &apos;re in a wonderful situation with electricity in the rich world .
but if we reduce the price -- let &apos;s turn the price half -- we meet a new barrier , and that barrier depends on co2 .
co2 warming the planet and equation for co2 is actually pretty clear .
they consume the excellent co2 , which leads to temperatures , and that temperatures have some very negative consequences -- effects on the weather and perhaps worse , which is direct that the natural ecosystems can &apos;t adapt to such rates of
now , the exact exact relationship between the carbon rise and the result of the temperature of temperatures and where the other consequences are , there are some units , but not very many .
and there &apos;s certainly discipline about how bad these consequences are , but they &apos;re going to be extremely bad !
i &apos;ve asked the top-class topics to say , &quot; do we really have to go down to close zero ?
not half or a quarter ? &quot;
the answer is , until we get close zero , the temperature will increase .
so it &apos;s a big challenge .
it &apos;s very different than saying , we have a three-foot truck , which needs to be under a three-foot truck , and then you can kind of squeeze them underneath .
this has got to go down , zero .
well , we &apos;re spreading a lot of carbon dioxide every year , over 26 billion tons .
every americans from 20 tons . people from poor countries , less than one .
it &apos;s about five tons for each one on the planet .
and somehow we have to make changes that reduce to zero .
it &apos;s been up all the time .
just different economic changes have actually affected , and we need to go down to reducing rates , and to reduce a reduction to zero .
this equation has four factors . a little multiplication . you have this thing on the left -- co2 -- that will bring you to zero , and it &apos;s dependent on the number of people , from the services that every person uses on average
so let &apos;s look at every factor , and we think about how we get that to zero .
probably one of those numbers must come very close to zero .
now this is fundamental algebra , but let &apos;s go through it .
first of all , we have the population .
6.8 billion people live today .
and it causes nine billion to move to nine billion .
if we &apos;re very successful with new vaccines , health care and reproduction medicine , we could probably reduce 10 percent to 15 percent , but at the time we see a slope around 1.3 .
the second factor is the service we use .
that includes everything that we eat , clothing , clothing , tv , heating .
these are very good things and poverty reducing to make these services available almost every one on the planet .
it &apos;s great that this number goes up .
in the rich world , in the upper billion , we might be able to make abstract and less use , but on average , that number will increase every year and more than double , the number of services that each person will be provided .
here &apos;s a very basic service . is there light at home so you can read the homework ?
and these students don &apos;t have it , so they go out and read their school tasks under the streets .
now , in efficiency , the e.u. , the energy per service , it &apos;s finally good news .
we have something that doesn &apos;t increase .
because of different successes in the light sector , through other autodeses , through new ways in blocks , there are many services whose energy has some individual services that are going to reduce some of 90 percent .
in other services , like the fertilizer of fertilizers , 105 thousand : 05 : 55,000 -- &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; 55 : 5,000 or five thousand or five thousand .
in total , if we &apos;re optimistic , maybe we &apos;ll get an reduction in a factor of three or maybe even by one factor 6 .
but in the first three factors , we &apos;ve now gone from 26 billion to perhaps all the best 13 billion tons , and that &apos;s simply not enough .
so , let &apos;s look at the fourth factor -- and this is going to be a keyboard -- that &apos;s the amount of co2 that &apos;s embedded in per unit of energy .
it turns out that you can get that to zero .
if you burn coal , no .
if you burn natural gas : no .
almost every manufacturing tool for electricity today , co2 , except the renewables and nuclear power .
so what we need to do on a global level is to create a new system .
we need energy miracles .
now if i use the term &quot; miracle &quot; i don &apos;t mean the impossible .
the microprocessor is a miracle . the pc is a miracle .
the internet and its service is a miracle .
the people here have contributed to the development of many of these miracles .
normally there &apos;s no deadline that you need a miracle to a particular date .
normally , you &apos;re usually just going wrong and some are coming , others don &apos;t .
but in this case , we have to get full of full gas and get a miracle in very short time .
well , i wondered , how can i really bring this back ?
is there a natural illustration , a demonstration that &apos;s unleashing the idea of people here ?
i remember last year when i brought mosquitos , and somehow people liked it .
the idea was really tangible for them , you know , there are people living with mosquitos .
and for energy , this was what i came up with .
i decided that the free of fireflies would be my one-year-old contribution to the environment here .
so here are some natural fireflies .
i assure you they don &apos;t plays . they don &apos;t even get to leave the glass .
well , there are all kinds of playfulness like these , but they don &apos;t get much of them .
we need solutions , either one or a few that have unimaginable scaling and unimaginable reliability , and even though there are many directions where people are looking for them , i really see five , which can afford these big demands .
i &apos;ve left out malage , males , fusion and biofuels .
you may have a modern contribution , and if you do better than i expect , it would be great , but my package here is that we need to work on all of those five , and we can &apos;t give up any of them because
let &apos;s first look at the furn of fossil fuels , either coal or natural gas .
what you have to do there is perhaps just seem simple , but it &apos;s not . you &apos;d have to capture all the co2 that comes from the crank , capture , under pressure , and then store somewhere and hope it stays there .
there are some plotes that make it at a 60 percent -- 80 percent levels , but it &apos;s going to be a very difficult thing to get , and an agreement for the camp of co2 is a big challenge , but the biggest problem here
who &apos;s going to make it available ?
who can guarantee what literally many billion times larger than any kind of waste that you can imagine from nuclear and other things ?
that &apos;s a lot of volume .
so this is a tough one .
next , nuclear .
it also has three big problems . the cost , especially in the mainstream countries , is up . the question for safety is that you really feel that nothing can go wrong despite the human employment that the fuel is not used for weapons .
and then what do you do with the waste ?
because even though it &apos;s not very big , there &apos;s a lot of concern .
so three very difficult problems that might be soluble , and that &apos;s why you should work on .
the last three of the five , i &apos;ve summarized .
it &apos;s the renewables that they &apos;re often called .
and they have -- although it &apos;s great that they don &apos;t need fuel -- they have some disorders .
one is the energy density that makes these technologies dramatically lower than those of power stations .
these are energy cars , you &apos;re talking about many square kilometers , a thousand times more area than a normal power station .
furthermore , these sources of sources .
the sun doesn &apos;t seem the whole day , it doesn &apos;t seem the day , and it doesn &apos;t seem the same .
so if you &apos;re dependent on those sources , you have a way of getting energy in time when you &apos;re not available .
so there are big prices . there are challenges in transmission . if we say that the energy source is outside the country , you don &apos;t just need the technology , you have to deal with risk that the energy from where you come from .
and there &apos;s the transportation .
and in order to show the dimension , i have all kinds of batteries that are made , looking at cars , computers , cell phones , pockets , for everything . and that &apos;s what i &apos;ve been doing with the amount of electronic
so we need a big breakthrough here , something that is going to be a factor of 100 better than the approach at the time .
that &apos;s not impossible , but it &apos;s not that easy .
this is what happens when you try to bring these interrupted sources about say 20 percent -- 30 percent of the use .
if you want to support 100 percent of it , you need an incredible fubzy .
now , where should we go , what &apos;s the right approach ?
a manhattan project ? how do we get at the goal ?
what we need is a lot of companies working on it . hundreds of them .
in each of those five areas we need at least 100 people .
in many , they will say they &apos;re crazy ! that &apos;s good .
i think there are many that are already engaged in ted group here .
bill grand has several companies , among others one called the saliar that has great technologies like this .
volce hosbands invest in dozens of companies who do great things and have interesting possibilities , and i try to support this .
nathan myhrvold and i fund a company that , perhaps surprisingly , is tracking the nuclear approach .
there are some innovations in the nuclear area ; moore , liquid .
the development in this industry has heard a couple of time ago , so it &apos;s not a great surprise that some good concepts are lying around .
the terraintop idea means that instead of the urans , one percent , the 223 , we decided to burn the 99 percent , the 2288 .
that &apos;s a pretty crazy idea .
but in fact , you &apos;ve been thinking about it for a long time , but you couldn &apos;t have any reasonable simulating whether it &apos;s going to work , but since there &apos;s modern supercomputers , you can simulate it and see that , yes
and because you &apos;re burning this 99 percent , the cost of cost is much better .
in fact , you burn the waste , and you can even use the waste of today &apos;s reactors as a glue .
instead of breaking your head , you just burn it . a great thing .
the uranium is consumed so well , a little bit like a candle .
you can see that it &apos;s a kind of column , often called a &quot; traveling wave reactor . &quot;
that really solves the fuel problem .
here &apos;s a picture of a place in kentucky .
this is the waste , the 99 percent . you have the part that &apos;s burned up today , so it &apos;s called proven uan .
that &apos;s what the u.s. is doing for hundreds of years .
and when you filter ocean water and simply filter it , you get enough fuel for the rest of the planet &apos;s life .
you know , there are many challenges , but it &apos;s an example of many hundreds of concepts that we need to come forward .
let &apos;s think about how we should measure our success .
what should our concepts look like ?
well , let &apos;s go to the goal that we need to reach , and then we talk about the middle .
many talks from an 80 percent reduction by 2050 .
it &apos;s really very important that we get there .
the rest of the 20 percent will be created in poor countries , and still agriculture . hopefully , whales and ceiling will be clean to it .
so , to reach this 80 percent , the industrialized countries have to put together , including countries like china , their electrozar generation completely .
the other note says whether we &apos;re using the zero-emissions of technology whether they &apos;re used in all developed countries , and we &apos;re on the way to get them to the rest .
that &apos;s super important .
this is going to be a key issue of this stuff .
when we go back from there , what should the 2020 guess look like ?
it should contain the two elements again .
we should use effectiveness to get reduction on the way . the less we represent , the smaller the co2 will be , and also the temperature .
but in fact , this note for the things that we &apos;re doing is not entirely to the great reduction , just the same , or even a little less important like the speed of innovation for these breakthroughs .
we have to track these breakthroughs with full gas , and we can measure that : in companies , in graphics and regulations .
there are many great books on this topic .
the al gore book , &quot; we have the choice , &quot; and david mccay &quot; subtle energy will thor the hot air . &quot;
they really go through it and create a framework where this can be discussed broadly , because we need support from all sides .
there &apos;s a couple of things that have to come together .
that &apos;s a wish .
very compelling desire that we invent this technology .
if you gave me only one wish for the next 50 years , i could choose the president , a vaccine , and i love that wish , or i could choose this wish , which is a half-year-old energy price without co2 .
this has the biggest effect .
if we don &apos;t get that wish , the grades will be terrible between long-term and short-term thinking people , between the united states and china , between poor and rich countries , and almost all of the lives of those two billion are going to
so what do we need to do ?
what is the application of me ?
we have to use for more research .
if countries are meeting in places like copehagen , they shouldn &apos;t only talk about co2 .
you should discuss this innovation strategy , and you would be shocked by the ridiculous little songs that are being spent on these innovative approaches .
we need marketin to control co2 , coach &amp; amp ; mix something that creates a price signal .
we have to spread the message .
we need dialogue to be rational and full and also the things that are going to be done by government .
it &apos;s an important wish , but i think we can fulfill it .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you . thank you !
thank you very much . just to understand terraintop a little bit better -- first of all , can you give us an idea of scale of this investment ?
bill gates : to do the simulation on a supercomputer , get all the great scientists , what we &apos;ve done , we only need some 10 million , and even if we tested our materials in a russian reactor to make sure that it
the tricky step is to build the first reactor , find another billion , the regulation and the place of that actually build the first one .
once the first thing is done , when it &apos;s promising , it &apos;s all clear , because the economy , the energy density , is as different as nuclear as we know it .
to understand that right : that means building deep into the ground almost like a vertical column of nuclear fuel , that used urans , and then the process begins , and is it working on the bottom ?
bag : right . now , you &apos;ve got to release the reactor , so there &apos;s a lot of people and many controls that can go wrong . this thing where you open it and get things in , or get out . that &apos;s not
but if you have very cheap fuel , you can fill it for 60 years -- think of a column that you bury without all the complexities .
and it &apos;s sitting there and burning for 60 years and then it &apos;s done .
a nuclear reactor that provides a solution to the trash .
grid : yes . well , what happens to the waste : you can sit down -- there &apos;s a lot less waste with this method -- then you take it and put it in the next reactor and you burn it .
and we start by taking the waste that exists in these crabs , or dry reserves in these respects , and that &apos;s our nitrogen fuel .
so what &apos;s a problem for these reactors is what we &apos;re in our fibers , and that &apos;s dramatically reducing the waste of waste during this process .
but while they talked to different people of the world about these possibilities .
where is the most important interest of what &apos;s really going on ?
bag : well , we haven &apos;t set up on a place yet , and there &apos;s a lot of interesting regulations for everything called the nuclear &quot; name , &quot; and the people of the company were in russia , india , china -- i was
i &apos;m optimistic . you know , the french and japan have done something in the direction .
this is a version of one thing that was made .
this is an important step forward , but it &apos;s like a faster reactor , and some countries have built these , so anyone who has turned a quick reactor , a candidate for our first .
in your imagination : to call time frame and probability to really live in life ?
borders : well , we need one of these scalable , strength things that are very cheap , we &apos;ve got 20 years to invent and then 20 years .
this is sort of the deadline that has shown us the environmental models that we need to contain .
and , you know , terrapower , if everything goes well , and that &apos;s a big wish , could hold it easy .
and fortunately , there are dozens of companies today , and we need hundreds of them , the same as their approaches work that will work for their pilots , can offer it .
and it would be best when it makes a difference , because then you could use a mixture .
anyway , we need a solution .
does the great possible breakthrough , is this the biggest thing you know ?
borders : a energy breakdown is the most important thing .
that would have been without the environmental challenge , but it does so much more important .
there are other innovative companies in the nuclear sector .
you know , we don &apos;t know their work as well as these , but there &apos;s the modular method , which is a different approach .
there &apos;s a liquid reactor that seems something hard , but maybe that &apos;s about us .
and so it &apos;s different , but the beauty of this is that an elephant molecule has a million times as much energy as one , say , a coal molecule , and therefore , if you can deal with the problems , the footprint , the
if that doesn &apos;t work , then what ?
do we need to introduce novelty to try and keep the natural temperature stable ?
boil : when you come to this situation , it &apos;s like you &apos;ve eaten too much , and you &apos;re standing in front of a heart attack , and what do you do ? you might need a heart operation or something like that .
there &apos;s a research that is called geoineine , which is involved with various techniques in ordering warming , so that we &apos;re spending 20 or 30 years longer to put us together .
this is just one insurance .
we hope that we don &apos;t need that .
some people say you shouldn &apos;t be working at all in insurance because it may make you black , so you keep eating , because you know that you &apos;re going to save heart operation .
i don &apos;t know if the smart thing is , if you take the importance of this problem , but there &apos;s now a discourse in engineering about whether you should have that , if things take faster , or need that innovation longer than we expect .
clasas skeptics : do you have one or two sentences for those to convince you perhaps ?
bg : well , unfortunately , the skeptics live in very different camps .
the ones who make scientific arguments are very little .
do you say there are negative effects to do with the clouds that move things ?
there are very , very few things that you can even tell , which is an opportunity in a million .
the main problem here is similar to aids .
you make the mistake now , and you pay for it much later .
and so the idea is , now , if you have all sorts of interconnected problems to invest in something that you only have later -- and that &apos;s what the investment is not so clear : in fact , the ipcc reporter is not necessarily the
the fact is that that uncertainty should be worried about us .
but my dream here is that if you can make it economic , and at the same time , the skeptics are also saying , &quot; okay , i don &apos;t care that it &apos;s not a co2 , i wish it did , but i &apos;m going
and that would be their answer to the bjorn loombian argument that if you &apos;re using all of this time and energy to solve the co2 problem , all the other goals suffer , the poverty decrease , the reduction of malaria , and so
bag : well , the actual spending for research -- say the u.s. should spend 10 billion a year more than they do today -- that &apos;s not so dramatic .
among other things , other things should not be suffered .
you come to great money , and here you can disagree with reasonable people , if you have something that is not economic , and you try to fund that . it &apos;s most wasteful for me .
it &apos;s because , you know , you &apos;re very short before a cost of cost and just funding the learning curve , and i think we should try more things that have potential to be very cheaper .
if the abstraction you get , a very high energy price , you can only hold the rich .
i mean , every one of us here could spend five times as much for our energy without changing its lifestyle .
for the lower two billion , it &apos;s a disaster .
and even lormones think about it .
now , his new mask is now , &quot; why don &apos;t research tell us anymore ? &quot;
it &apos;s still associated because of his earlier stories with the skeptic camp , but he understood that this is a very lonely group , and so he &apos;s now bringing the research argument .
and that &apos;s a memorial that i think is appropriate .
the research , it &apos;s just crazy how little it &apos;s going to support .
bill , i think i &apos;m talking for almost all people here , when i say , i really hope your wish will be true . thank you very much .
grid : thank you .
a couple of years ago at ted , peter sharman asked a design competition called &quot; the marshmallow prototype . &quot;
the idea is pretty simple . four teams need the biggest possible structure of 20 spaghetti , about one tape , to build about one of the things and a marshmallow .
the marshmallow must be on top .
and , even though it seems really simple , it &apos;s actually really hard , because it &apos;s getting people to collaborate very quickly .
and so i thought this is an interesting idea , and i turned it into design workshop .
it was a huge success .
since then , i &apos;ve been doing about 70 workshops around the world , with students , developers and architects , even with the pursuit of the forager companies , and there &apos;s something about this task which enables deep sensativity to the
usually most people start to orient themselves to the task .
you talk about it , what it looks like , it &apos;s accelerating to make power .
then you invest a little bit of time in planning and organization , and you sketch and put spaghetti .
they invest most of their time in the building together constantly growing .
and finally , just before you don &apos;t have time , someone takes the marshmallow , and they put him right at the top , step back and , &quot; tada , &quot; they admire their work .
but what happens , almost always , is that the &quot; ta-da &quot; becomes a &quot; uh-huh &quot; because it causes the weight of the marshmallow , that the whole thing is defeated and displaced .
there are a series of people who have a lot more &quot; uh-oh &quot; moment than others , and among the worst are fresh speed grades .
they lie , they cheat , they &apos;re confused and they &apos;re really dressed .
and of course , there are teams that have much more &quot; tada , &quot; and among the best are fresh graduents of kindergarten .
and that &apos;s pretty amazing .
like peter , they don &apos;t just produce the highest towers , but also the most interesting structures of all .
what you might be asking is : why is that ? why ? what about those ?
and peter says , &quot; none of the children spend time in the head of spaghetti gbh . &quot;
they don &apos;t invest time in convulsions .
there &apos;s another reason yet .
and that is that scl-students were trained to find a right plan , ok !
and then realize it .
what happens when you put the marshmallow on the top , you don &apos;t have time , and what happens ?
it &apos;s a crisis .
sounds familiar , what ?
what children &apos;s children do differently is they start with the marshmallow and they build prototypes , successful prototypes , always with the marshmallow at the top , so they have a chance to repair volunteers of prototypes .
constructors recognize this kind of collaboration as a core of an initiative process .
and with every trial the children get immediate feedback what works and what doesn &apos;t .
so the performance is to work with prototypes , central -- but see how different teams act .
the average for most of us , at about 50 , and the half of them , are creating half of them , lawyers a little bit more , but not much , children &apos;s children are better than adults .
who &apos;s the most successful ?
architects and engineers , for happiness .
one is the highest i &apos;ve seen .
and why ? because they understand triangles and self-assembly geometric patterns are the key to build robust structures .
ceos are about average . but this is where it gets interesting .
you put an extra administrator on the team , you get better .
it &apos;s incredible . you look around and you see , &quot; this team will win . &quot;
you can predict that . why is that ?
because they have special skills of automobile .
you run the process , you understand him .
and this team that regulates and looks at work is going to improve the performance of the team .
specialized skills and processes and their combination leads to success .
if you have 10 teams that do typical , you get about six that have robust structures .
so i tried something exciting now .
i thought , let &apos;s bring the packaging right away .
so i offered a $ 10,000 prize on software for the winner .
what do you think happened to these design students ?
what was the result ?
this was happening . not a team had a stable structure .
if anyone had built a high-range construction , he would have carried the price home .
so is it not interesting that high findings have a strong effect ?
we repeated this exercise with the same students .
what do you think happened ?
now you understand the advantage of the prototype .
so from the same , bad team , one under the best .
they produced the highest construction in the least time .
so there &apos;s profound lessons for us , about nature of drive and success .
you might ask : why would someone actually invest time a marshmallow class ?
the reason is , i &apos;m going to help digital tools and processes to help teams , cars , video games , video games and visual effects .
and what the marshmallow class does , it helps you identify hidden assumptions .
because frankly , every project has its own marshmallow .
the challenge offers a shared experience , a common language , or foundation , to build the right prototype .
and this is the value of this experience , this simple practice .
and those of you who are interested in this can visit marshmallow stone nets .
it &apos;s a blog where you see how you build the marshmallow .
there &apos;s a step-up-step place there .
they find crazy examples of all the world , how people optimize and fix the system .
there are also world records .
and the baseline lesson , i think , is actually a connected sport .
it requires that we all have our senses on the task , and that we use our thinking optimal , like our feelings and our do , in the challenge that lies ahead .
and sometimes a little prototype of this experience is everything that takes us from a &quot; uh-oh &quot; -- to a &quot; ta-da &quot; moment .
and that can make a big difference .
thank you .
like we have a machine here .
a big machine , a cool ted machine , and that &apos;s a time machine .
and everybody in this room needs to go in .
and you can go to the past , you can go into the future ; you can &apos;t stay in here and now .
and i wonder what they would choose because i &apos;ve asked my friends a lot last time , and they wanted to go to the past .
i don &apos;t know . they wanted to go back in time before there were cars or twitter or &quot; america , &quot; the superstar .
i don &apos;t know .
i &apos;m convinced that somehow you &apos;ve moved to nostalle , to surveillance .
and i understand that .
i &apos;m not part of this group , i have to say .
i don &apos;t want to go into the past , not because i &apos;m an adventer .
it &apos;s because the possibilities on this planet don &apos;t go back , they go forward .
so i want to go into this machine , and i want to go to the future .
this is the most great time that we &apos;ve ever had on this planet , no matter what the scale of it is : health , wealth , mobility , opportunities , declining disease rates .
there was never a time like this before .
my mother-grandparents died all when they were 60 .
my grandparents got this number on 70 .
my parents are 80 on the fingers .
so there should be better one nine at the beginning of my death row .
but it &apos;s not even about people like us , because that &apos;s a bigger thing than that .
a child who might expect to be born in new delhi as long as the richest man in the world 100 years ago .
think about it . that &apos;s an incredible fact .
and why is that ?
smallpox . smallpox killed billions of people on this planet .
they &apos;ve transformed the demographics of the earth in a way that no war has ever done .
they &apos;re gone . they &apos;re gone .
we have them forced . pop .
in the rich world there are diseases that are even threatened by millions of us only one generation .
diplomacy , tubs , paralysis ...
does anybody know what that is ?
vaccines , modern medicine , our ability to feed billions of people , these are successes of the scientific method .
and from my view is the scientific method of trying to try things out , see if it works , change it if it doesn &apos;t , one of the great achievements of humanity .
so that &apos;s the good news .
unfortunately , that &apos;s all the good news , because there &apos;s some other problems , and they &apos;ve been mentioned often .
and one of them is that despite all of our achievements , a billion people on this world go hungry to sleep every day .
that number goes up , and it &apos;s increasing very fast , and that &apos;s damaging .
and not only that , we used our imagination to devastate this world .
drinking water , urban country , rainforests , oil , gas : they disappear , and that &apos;s soon , and if we don &apos;t get out of that chaos from that chaos .
so the question is : can we do that ? i think it is .
i think it &apos;s clear that we can produce food that will feed billions of people without the country that they live on .
i think we can power this world with energy that doesn &apos;t destroy at the same time .
i really believe that , and no , that &apos;s not a wish .
but this is holding me awake -- one of the things that &apos;s going to wake me at night . we &apos;ve never needed scientific progress as well as now , never .
and we &apos;ve never been able to make it reasonable , as we can today .
we &apos;re on the threshold of amazing events in many areas , and yet i really think that we have to go back hundreds and 300 years before the enlightenment to find a time where we &apos;ve suggested about these things that we &apos;ve
people are hiding in their beliefs , and so closely they can &apos;t free them .
not even the truth will free you .
and listen , everyone has a right on its opinion ; even a right on its opinion of progress .
but you know what they &apos;re not right about ?
they don &apos;t have a right on their own facts . &quot; advice , they don &apos;t .
and i took a while to figure that out .
so , about a decade ago , i wrote an article on vaccine for &quot; the new yorker , &quot; which is a little article .
and i was amazed to get out on resistance , on resistance to what &apos;s the most effective measure of health care in human history .
i didn &apos;t know what to do , so i just did whatever i do , i wrote an article and went on .
and soon after that , i wrote an article about genetically transformed food .
same thing , only bigger .
people were playing crazy .
so i &apos;ve written an article about this , and i couldn &apos;t understand why people thought that would be &quot; france , &quot; why they believed that molecules were shocked in a certain way by an accidental way of nature .
but you know , i do what i do . i wrote the article , i continued .
i mean , i &apos;m a journalist .
we type , we make one , we eat , that &apos;s okay .
but these articles worried me , and i couldn &apos;t figure out why , and finally , i figured it out .
and that &apos;s because these fanors who were crazy at all were not a fanatari .
these were intense people , educated people , decent people .
they were just like the people in this room .
and that brought me together like this .
but then i thought , you know what , let &apos;s face it .
we &apos;ve been at a point where we don &apos;t have the same relationship to progress as we used to .
we &apos;re talking about it .
we talk about it ironically with small leadership , and we &apos;re talking about progress .
okay , there are reasons , and i think we know what reason that is .
we have the trust in institutions , authority , and sometimes in science , and there &apos;s no reason why it should not be that way .
you can just call a few names and people will understand .
chernobyl , dupal , the chunks , vioxx , mass destruction , the u.s. presidential election , 2000 .
i mean , you know , you can choose your own list .
there are questions and problems with the people we thought they were right . so be skeptical .
ask questions , demand evidence , demand evidence .
don &apos;t take anything for granted .
but now comes : if you get evidence you have to take this evidence , and we &apos;re not good at that .
and i can tell that that we &apos;re now living in an epidemic of fear , as i &apos;ve never seen before , and i would never see again .
about 12 years ago , a story was published , a terrible story that brought the autism epidemic with masks , mumbps , and tucked vaccine .
very scary .
some studies have been done to see if that was true .
and a lot of studies should be done ; it &apos;s a serious business .
the data came in .
the data came out of the united states , from england , from sweden , from canada , and they were all the same , no correlation , no connection , at all .
it doesn &apos;t matter . it doesn &apos;t matter because we believe in anecdotes , we believe what we see , what makes us think what makes us feel real .
we don &apos;t believe in a packaging of a government of government that gives us data , and i understand that , i think we all do .
but you know what ?
the result was disastrous .
disastrous because of that fact , the united states is one of the only countries in the world where the impulses for masks are singing .
that &apos;s scene and we should be ashamed .
it &apos;s awful .
what happened is that we could do that .
well i understand that . i do .
because here &apos;s somebody here ?
does any one in the audience ever die of masks ?
not very often happening .
not at all in this country , but 160,000 times in the world last year .
that &apos;s a lot of deaths by masers , 20 per hour .
but because that &apos;s not happening here , we can deny it , and people like jenny mccarmahy can walk around and messages of platforms and illiteracy like oprah and larry king live .
and they can make it because they don &apos;t connect cause and correlation .
they don &apos;t understand that these things seem equal , but almost never the same is the same .
and this is something we need to learn , very quickly .
this guy was a hero , jonas salk .
he released us from one of the worst geeks of humanity .
no fear , no quarters , paralysis , spark , disappeared .
the guy in the middle is not so much .
it &apos;s called paul suit .
he has just developed redavir vaccine with some other people .
he can save the lives of 400 , 500,000 children a year in the developing world .
pretty good , isn &apos;t it ?
well , that &apos;s good , except that paul talks around and talks about vaccines and says how valuable you are , and people should stop juggling .
and that actually tells you this .
so paul is a terrorist .
if paul talks in a public conspiracy , he can &apos;t say it without an armed guilty .
he gets calls at home because people like to tell him they know where to go to school .
why ? because paul has made a vaccine .
i don &apos;t need to say that , but vaccines are essential .
take it forward , remove the diseases , terrible diseases , and that &apos;s happening right now .
we have maskers now in this country .
and that gets worse , and pretty soon children will die again because that &apos;s just a question of numbers .
and they &apos;re not just going to die of masters .
what about paralyzation ? let &apos;s take it . why not ?
a couple of weeks ago , i was written by a couple of weeks ago , and i said , &quot; i think i &apos;m a little bit too writing . &quot;
nobody said that before .
she wouldn &apos;t immunize her child against plastic paralysis .
enety .
why ? because we don &apos;t have paralyzation . and you know what ?
we didn &apos;t have paralysis in this country yesterday .
today , i don &apos;t know , maybe someone in lagos is going into an airplane , and it &apos;s just going to los angeles at the moment , at the moment , about ohio .
and in a couple of hours he lands and rent a car , and he &apos;s coming to long beach , and he &apos;s going to visit one of these amazing ted dinosaurs at night .
and he doesn &apos;t know that he &apos;s infected with a remarkable disease , and we don &apos;t know , because that &apos;s how the world works .
this is the planet that we live on . don &apos;t as if it &apos;s not .
we love to hill in lies . we love that .
have you all taken their vitamins up this morning ?
ecstering , a small disturbing jazz that helps you to move on the leaps .
i know they did that because half of americans do this every day .
they take the stuff , and they take alternative cure , and it doesn &apos;t matter how often we find that they &apos;re useless .
the data always suggests this .
they defeat their urine . they &apos;re almost never doing it .
that &apos;s okay , you want to pay 28 billion dollars for dark uin .
i agree with them completely .
dark uin . dark .
why do we do that ? why do we do that ?
well , i think i understand -- we hate the drug industry .
we hate a lot of government . we don &apos;t have trust in the system .
and that &apos;s not what we should . our healthcare system is mix .
it &apos;s cruel to millions of people .
it &apos;s absolutely amazing , and it &apos;s separated ourselves to us that can afford it .
so we walk away , and where are we running ?
we &apos;re going to the poor of the space industry .
that &apos;s great . i love the space industry .
but you know , that &apos;s really a serious issue , because the stuff is crap , and we &apos;re spending billions of dollars on it .
and i have all kinds of little revenue here .
none of them -- chose , cheating , ecosystem , crank , aiai , i don &apos;t even know what that is , but we &apos;re spending billions of dollars on it .
and you know what ? when i say that , people scream to me and say , &quot; what cares ? let &apos;s do the people doing what you want .
that &apos;s how they feel good . &quot;
and you know what ? they &apos;re wrong .
because i don &apos;t care whether it &apos;s the health minister , which says , &quot; hmm , i &apos;m not going to take the evidence of my experts to mammography , &quot; or any cancer square , who wants to treat his patient with a
if you go to that path where belief and magic is replacing and science , you get to a place where you don &apos;t want to be .
they get to thaa mbeki in south africa .
he brought 400,000 of his people , because he felt that red angels , but , much more effective and quotes , are much more effective than antiretroviral drugs that we know that they can detect the course of aids .
hundreds of thousands of disturbing deaths in a country that is being worse than any other from this disease .
don &apos;t tell me that these things don &apos;t have consequences .
they have them . they always have them .
now , the brain disabled epidemic , where we &apos;re right now , is this ridiculous struggle between the resonates of genuine food and the bio-elite .
this is an idioting debate . it must stop .
it &apos;s a debate about words , about metaphor .
this is ideology , not science .
all we eat , every rice , every branch of peter , every pharmaceutical , has been changed by people .
you know , there were no manufacturing in paradise .
there were no bumps on them .
there were no christmas trees . we did all this .
we &apos;ve done it over the last 11,000 years .
and some of it has worked and some of them don &apos;t work .
we got rid of what didn &apos;t work .
now we can make it more important , and of course there are risks , but we can do something like vitamin a in rice , and the stuff can help millions of people extend millions of people to extend their lives .
you don &apos;t want to do that ?
i have to say that i don &apos;t understand .
we reject genetically transformed foods .
why do we do that ?
now , what i &apos;m listening to is : too many chemicals , pesticides , hormones , monkeys , we don &apos;t want a huge fields with one thing , that &apos;s wrong .
we don &apos;t want companies to patent lives .
we don &apos;t want companies to own seeds .
and you know what my answer to all of this is ?
yes , you &apos;re right . let &apos;s fix it .
it &apos;s true , we have a huge food operation , but that &apos;s not science .
it didn &apos;t have anything to do with science .
it &apos;s right , morality , patent .
you know science is not a company .
it &apos;s not a country .
it &apos;s not even an idea ; it &apos;s a process .
it &apos;s a process , and sometimes it doesn &apos;t work and sometimes it doesn &apos;t work , but the idea that we should not allow science to do their work , because we &apos;re afraid of it , and it holds millions of people from flash .
you know , over the next 50 years , we &apos;ll have to grow 70 percent more food than at the moment . 70 percent .
this investment in africa over the last 30 years .
shame . shame .
you need that , and we don &apos;t give it to them .
why ? why ? genetically transformed food .
we don &apos;t want to encourage people to eat this deaded stuff , like manipulation .
shame is something that eats half a billion people .
it &apos;s kind of like a potato .
it &apos;s just a packaging calories . it &apos;s mix .
it doesn &apos;t have nutrients ; it doesn &apos;t have any protein , and scientists are building all these things in there .
and then people could eat that and wouldn &apos;t be blind .
you wouldn &apos;t starry , you know what ?
that would be nice . it wouldn &apos;t be chezap , but it would be nice .
and all i can say is : why do we fight this ?
i mean , let &apos;s ask : why are we fighting this ?
because we want no genes to go around ?
it &apos;s not about genes . it &apos;s not about chemicals .
it &apos;s not about our ridiculous passion for hormones , our resistance to greater food , better food , unique food .
it &apos;s not about rice components , it &apos;s about preserving people alive , and it &apos;s going to be time to understand what that means .
because you know what ?
if we don &apos;t do that , if we do so far , we &apos;re going to be guilty of something that i don &apos;t think we want to be guilty of , high-tech colonialism .
there is no other description for what &apos;s happening here .
it &apos;s selfish , it &apos;s ugly , it &apos;s not worthy , and we must really stop it .
so after this incredibly funny conversation , you may say , &quot; do you still want to go into this ridiculous time machine and go into the future ? &quot;
anyway . i certainly want that .
at the moment , it &apos;s in the present moment , but we have an incredible opportunity .
we can do this time machine on everything we want .
we can move them around where we want to move them , and we will move them wherever we want them .
we have to lead these conversations , and we need to think , but if we go to the time machine and we &apos;re going to go to the future , we will be happy to have that .
i know that we can , and as far as i &apos;m concerned , this is something the world needs now .
thank you .
thank you .
for some time , i &apos;m interested in the plumb effect . it may seem strange that a magician is interested in it , unless you look at it like me , as &quot; a deception that gets something real , if somebody believes just enough
in other words , sugar pills have shown a measurable effect in some studies , the plumb effect , and that &apos;s because the person thinks what &apos;s happening to her is a pharmaceutical or kind of ... in pain , for example , if
a deception becomes something real , because somebody perceives it like this .
so , as we understand each other , i want to show you an elemental , simple magic trick .
and i &apos;m going to show you how it works . this is a trick that &apos;s at least since the 1950s for children .
i had learned him from the chaos scratch magical in the 1970s .
i &apos;ll make it happen for you and then explain it .
and then i &apos;ll explain why i explain it .
so , look what happens .
the knife you can study ; my hand that you can study .
i &apos;m going to hold the knife like this in my feather .
i shoot my sleeve back .
and to make sure that nothing in my sleeve is disappearing or coming out of it , i &apos;m just going to put my wrist right here right here .
in this way , you can see that no time is going to move anything . as long as i listen here , nothing can go out in my sleeve or come out .
and the objective of that is very simple .
i &apos;m going to open my hand , and hopefully if everything goes well , the knife is stuck through my block of physical magnetism .
it &apos;s actually so clear in its place that i can shake it without the knife dropping down .
nothing goes into my sleeve or coming out , not a trickster , and you can study everything .
the da-da !
now , this is a trick that i often spend young children interested in magic , because you can learn a lot about deception when you look closer , even though it &apos;s a very simple express trick .
probably many of you know here in the room that trick .
he works like this .
i hold the knife in my hand .
i &apos;m saying that i &apos;ll concentrate my wrist to make sure that nothing is disappearing in my sleeve or coming out , and that &apos;s a lie .
the reason i hold my wrist is that it &apos;s the real secret of illusion .
in the moment , where i turn my hand away from you so you see them from behind , this finger moves here , my stick , just from where it was , in a position where it &apos;s so extended .
great trick ?
there is somebody sitting there who doesn &apos;t have childhood .
so , he &apos;s here . right .
and when i turn around , the finger changes its position .
and now you could talk about why this is a deception , why you don &apos;t realize that there &apos;s only three fingers down here : because the mind and the way it processes information , is not one , one , two , three ,
but that &apos;s not what i &apos;m doing right now . and then i open my hand .
of course , it &apos;s stuck there , but not through the magnetism of my body , but through a trick , through my show that &apos;s now there .
and when i conclude my hand , the same thing happens by turning me back , it &apos;s going to be buried by this movement that the finger moves again .
i take that hand away . and here &apos;s the knife .
this trick can introduce you to your friends and neighbors . thank you .
now , what does this have to do with the plumb effect ?
a year ago or so , i read a study that really returned me right .
i &apos;m not a doctor or a researcher , and so that was an amazing thing to me .
and it turns out that if you offer a place in the form of a white pill , in the form of an aspiration , it &apos;s just a round , white pill that has a certain measurable effect .
but if you give the shape that you give to the location , for example , it changes into smaller pill , and you &apos;re changing these blue blue , and you &apos;re actually measurable , and you &apos;re actually measurably more effective .
and that , even though none of those pharmaceuticals -- it &apos;s just sugar pills .
but a white pill is not as good as a blue pill .
what ? that made me really freak out .
but it turns out that that &apos;s not all .
if you take capsules , it &apos;s more effective than tagging every form .
a colored capsule that is yellow at one end and on the other red is better than a white capsule .
the dosage matters a role .
a pill twice is not as good as three pills -- i can &apos;t remember the exact statistic now . sorry .
but the key thing is , ...
-- that the dosage play a role as well .
and the shape plays a role .
and if you want to have the ultimate plumb effect , you have to attack the needle .
right ? a syringe with an effective -- a few millisters of an effective substance that you inject a patient .
it creates a very strong picture in your head . that &apos;s much stronger than a white pill .
this graph is really -- i &apos;m going to show you another time if we have a project .
so the fact is that the white pill is not as good as the blue pill that doesn &apos;t work as well as a capsule that doesn &apos;t act as well as the needle .
and none of that has any really pharmaceutical property , and it &apos;s just our belief in which it makes a stronger effect .
i wanted to know if i could use this idea for a magic trick .
i take something that &apos;s obviously a deception , and i make it look real .
we know from that study that you have to attack for the needle when it &apos;s going to go .
this is a 18 inches long . she &apos;s very , very painful , and i &apos;m going to get them a little sterile first .
this is really my meat . it &apos;s not joan special flesh .
this is my skin . this is not a special effect of hollywood .
i &apos;m now going to stick this needle into my skin and drive through it until she jumps on on the other side again .
if you go evil -- if you fall in there easily -- i took this a few friends last night in the hotel room , and some people i didn &apos;t know , and it has become almost neglected by a woman .
so i &apos;m suggesting that if you &apos;re going to get away , look away for the next 30 seconds , or , you know what , i &apos;m going to do the first cute part here .
you can see it right now , but you can see if you want to .
so , it goes right here , right here where my meat begins , at the bottom of my arm , i &apos;m just going to make a little woman .
i &apos;m really sorry . does she make it crazy ?
and just a little bit through my skin and on the other side of my skin .
now we &apos;re actually in the same situation that we had in the knife trick .
something .
but now you can &apos;t count my fingers , right ?
so , i &apos;m going to show you . that &apos;s one , two , three , four , five .
well , yeah .
i know what people think if you see this .
they say , &quot; okay , that &apos;s not so dumb , and you &apos;re just breaking your skin , just for a couple of minutes . &quot;
well , i &apos;m going to show it to you .
what does this look like ? pretty good .
yeah , i know .
and people go , &quot; okay . i didn &apos;t see this right . &quot;
people in the broadrooms now come in .
let me show you just close to you .
this is really my skin . that &apos;s not a special effect of hollywood .
this is my meat , and i can turn it around .
sorry . when you get evil , look away , don &apos;t look at it .
the people at the back or the one that will eventually look at video at some point will say , &quot; well , it looks quite impressive , but if it &apos;s real , he would -- look , here &apos;s a hole and where it really would
okay , let me break a little blood for you .
yeah , here it is .
i would now take the needle out now .
i would clean my arm and show you that there are no wounds .
but i think in this frame here and with the intention of doing something real , i &apos;m going to just leave the needle in there and go from the stage .
we &apos;ll meet a couple of times in the next couple of days .
i hope you &apos;re happy . thank you very much .
everyone &apos;s talking about happiness today .
i &apos;ve been giving some people to count the number of books that were published with &quot; happiness &quot; in the last five years , and they gave up after about 40 , and there was a lot more .
there &apos;s a huge wave of interest in happiness among researchers .
there &apos;s a lot of happiness cowth .
everybody would like to make people happier .
but despite all of these tides of work , there are several cognitive ones that are kind of impossible almost impossible to think about happiness .
and my talk today is mainly acting by these cognitive places .
this is true for lazy that is thinking about your own happiness , and it &apos;s true for scientists who think about happiness , because it turns out that we are as messy as everybody else .
the first one is to have a wireless , complexity .
it turns out that the word happiness is simply not a useful word anymore because we apply it to many different things .
i think there &apos;s a particular meaning that we might be able to do , but in the big part , this is something we need to give up , and we &apos;re going to have to embrace the complicated view of what well-being is .
the second trap is a confession of experience and memory : basically , it &apos;s between happy to be happy in his life and happiness about his life or happiness with his life .
and these are two very different concepts , and they &apos;re both collapsed in the notion of happiness .
and the third is the concentration of convention , and that &apos;s the unfortunate fact that we can &apos;t think about a situation that affects well-being without disturbing its meaning .
i mean , this is a real cognitive trap .
there &apos;s just no way to get it right .
now , i &apos;d like to start with an example of somebody who had a question and answer , after one of my lectures , who reported a story . &#91; unclear &#93; ... &#93; he said he heard a symphony , and it was
and then he added , really , really emotionally , that has ruined the whole experience .
but it didn &apos;t .
what it ruined was the memories of experience .
he had the experience .
he had had 20 minutes of lovely music .
they didn &apos;t count because he was remained with memory ; the memory was ruined , and the memory was all he had gotten to keep on .
what that really tells us is that we could think about ourselves and other people in the sense of two types of self .
there &apos;s an experience that lives in the present day and knows the present , capable of experiencing the past , but basically just the present .
it &apos;s the experience that the doctor suggests -- you know , when the doctor says , &quot; does it hurt if i touch them here ? &quot;
and then there &apos;s a reminder itself , and the memory itself is that it &apos;s going to count and the history of our life , and it &apos;s the one who suggests the doctor , &quot; how did you feel like , &quot; how did you
or , &quot; what was your journey to albania ? &quot; or something like that .
these are two very different units , the experience itself , and the memory itself , and to confuse those two , part of the notion of happiness .
now , the memory itself is a storyteller .
and that really begins with a fundamental response to our memories -- it starts immediately .
we don &apos;t just tell stories when we &apos;re doing telling stories .
our memory tells us stories , which is what we &apos;re allowed to keep in our experience is a story .
and let me start with an example .
there &apos;s an old study .
these are real patients moving to a painful procedure .
i won &apos;t go into the detail . it &apos;s not painful today , but it was painful when this study was done in the 1990s .
they were asked to report all 60 seconds on their pain .
and here are two patients . these are your records .
and they &apos;re going to ask , &quot; who &apos;s got more suffered ? &quot;
and that &apos;s a very simple question .
patient b has a lot more suffered . his own reflection was longer , and every minute of pain , the patient had a patient , and more .
but now there &apos;s another question : how very much these patients thought they were suffering ?
and here &apos;s a surprise .
and the surprise is that patient a a much worse reminder of the representation had a patient b.
the stories of the representation were different , and because a very critical part of the story is how it ends .
and none of these stories are very engineered or great -- but one of them is this clear ...
but one of them is clearly worse than the others .
and the worse was the where the pain was at the end of its peak , it &apos;s a bad story .
how do we know this ?
because we asked these people after their own reflection , and also much later , &quot; how bad was the whole thing ? &quot;
and she was much worse for a than b in the remorse .
now , this is a direct conflict between the experience itself and the reminder itself .
from the experience of the experience , b clearly had a bad time .
well , what you could do with patient , and we &apos;ve actually done clinical experiments , and it &apos;s been done , and it works , you could actually extend the reflection of patient to the patient , if you just don &apos;t get to be
that will lead the patient to be suffering , but just a little bit less than it is before .
and if you make this for a couple of minutes , the experience itself of patient is a bad thing , and you have a reason that the memories themselves of patient are much better , because now you have given patient a better story about his experience
what does a story draw from ?
and this is true of the stories that give us memory and it &apos;s also for the stories that we invent .
what a story is made of is quarries , major moments and end .
end is very , very important , and in this case dominated the end .
well the experience itself lives continuously .
it has moments of life , one after another .
and you ask : what happens to these moments ?
and the answer is really simple . they &apos;re lost forever .
i mean , most moments of our lives -- and i realized that -- you know , the psychological present is for about three seconds . what means , you know , there &apos;s about 600 million of them . in a month , there &apos;s about
most of them are completely ignored by reminders themselves .
and yet , somehow you get the impression that you should count that what &apos;s happening during this moments of life is our lives .
it &apos;s the limited resource that we use while we are in the world .
and how we use them would seem to be important , but that &apos;s not the story that keeps the memory itself for us .
so we have the memory itself and the experience itself , and they &apos;re really quite different .
the biggest difference between them is the time of time .
from the experience of the experience , if you have a vacation , and the second week is just as good as the first one , it &apos;s twice the face of preliminary vacation .
that doesn &apos;t work at all for the memory itself .
for the memories of self-interest , a previous vacation is hard than the vacation , because there &apos;s no new memories added .
they haven &apos;t changed the story .
and in this way , time is actually the critical variable that distinguishes a reminder of an experienced self , time has very little influence on this story .
now , the memory itself makes more than remember and telling stories .
it &apos;s actually the one that makes decisions , because if you have a patient , which , we say two different facilities in two different surgeons and decide what to choose , then the one who has the memory that is less bad , and that
the experience itself has no voice in this choice .
in fact , we don &apos;t choose between experience . we choose between memories of experiences .
and even if we think about the future , we don &apos;t usually think of our future as an experience .
we think about our future as preconceived memories .
and basically , you can look at this , you know , as a tyranny of the reminder , and you can think of the memory of yourself as one that &apos;s kind of drawn the experience itself through experiences that don &apos;t need the experience
i have the idea that if we &apos;re doing vacation that &apos;s very often the case , that means we &apos;re largely influenced in the service of the reminders .
and that &apos;s a little hard to think , i think .
i mean , how much do we reverse from our memories ?
this is one of the explanations that is given to the dominance of the reminder .
and when i think about it , i think of a vacation that we did a couple of years ago in antarctica , which was clearly the best vacation i had ever had , and i think relatively often about how often i think of
and i probably have the memories of my memorial journey , and i would say about 25 minutes for the last four years .
now , if i had ever opened the floor with the 600 pictures in it , i would have spent another hour .
now , these are three weeks , and that &apos;s six and a half hours .
there seems to be an epidemic .
well , i may be a little extreme , you know , how little appetite i have on the rewards of memories , but even if you do more of it , there &apos;s a real question . why are we going to give me
so i want you to think about an thought experiment .
imagine your next vacation , you know that at the end of the tahrir &apos;s end , all of your images are being destroyed and you get a identical drug so you &apos;re not going to remember anything .
now , would you choose the same vacation ?
and if you choose another vacation , there &apos;s a conflict between your two types of self , and you have to think about how you decide that conflict , and that &apos;s really not obvious at all , because if you think of time in the sense
why we choose confidence that we &apos;re looking for is a problem that gives us a choice between the two types of self .
well , the two types of self take two terms from happiness .
there are actually two concepts of happiness that we can apply , one per self .
so you can ask : how happy is the experience itself ?
and then you would ask : how happy are the moments in the experience of the experience ?
and you &apos;re all -- happiness for moments is a pretty complicated process .
what are the emotions that can be measured ?
and by the way , we &apos;re now able to get a pretty good idea from happiness in the experience of the experience itself .
if you ask the happiness of remember yourself , it &apos;s a very different thing .
it &apos;s not about how happy one person lives .
it &apos;s about how satisfaction or pleasure the person is when this person thinks about their lives .
very different term .
and anybody who doesn &apos;t distinct these terms will determine happiness as well , and i &apos;m a lot of researchers about well-being that have long-term exploration for happiness in the same way .
the distinction between the happiness of the experience itself and the satisfaction of the reminder itself has been recognized in the last few years , and now you &apos;re going to have to measure the two separation .
the gallup organism has a global survey where more than half a million people have been asked about what they think about their lives and about their experiences . and there were other efforts in the direction .
so over the last few years , we &apos;ve started learning about the happiness of the two types of self .
and the main lesson that we , i think , learned , is that they &apos;re really different .
you can know how happy someone is with his life , and that doesn &apos;t really kill you a lot of how happy he lives his life and vice versa .
just to give you a sense of correlation , the correlation is about .
what that means is that if you were to meet someone , and you would say , oh , his father is a two-meter man , how much would you know about his size ?
well , you would know something about its size , but there &apos;s a lot of uncertainty .
they have so much uncertainty .
and when i tell you that somebody has a life at a scale at a scale of 10 , they have a lot of uncertainty about how happy he is with his own experience .
the correlation is short .
we know something about the happiness of happiness itself .
we know that money is very important , goals are very important .
we know that happiness means to be content with people that we like to spend time with people we like .
there &apos;s other pleasure , but that &apos;s dominant .
so if you want to maximize the happiness of the two types of self , you &apos;re going to end up with very different things .
the conclusion of what i said here is that we really should not imagine happiness as a substitute for well-being .
it &apos;s a completely different term .
well , very shortly , another reason that we can &apos;t realize about happiness is that we don &apos;t look at the same things when we think about life and when we actually live .
so if you ask the simple question , how happy people are in california , they &apos;re not going to get the correct answer .
if you ask this question , you think people have to be happier in california when they say , in ohio .
and what happens is that when you think about life in california , you think about the difference between california and other places , and that difference is , say , on climate .
well it turns out that climate is not very important for the experience itself , and it &apos;s not even very important for the thinking self that decides how happy people are .
now , because the thinking self is responsible , you can at the end -- some people could go to california at the end .
and it &apos;s kind of interesting to track , which is what happens to people who move to california in the hope of getting happier .
well , your experience itself is not going to become happier .
we know that .
but one thing is going to happen . you &apos;re going to think that you &apos;re happier , because if you think about it , you &apos;re going to remind you how awful the weather was in ohio , and you &apos;re feeling that you made the
it &apos;s very hard to think about well-being , and i hope i have a sense of how hard it is .
thank you .
thank you . i have a question for you .
thank you .
now , when we were talking about a couple of weeks ago , there was a pretty interesting result that came out of this gallup survey .
is this something that you can share with you because you &apos;ve left a few minutes ?
daniel kunman : sure .
i think the most interesting result that we found in the gallup survey is a number we had absolutely not expected to find out .
we found that in terms of the happiness of the experience itself .
when we looked at how feelings are variing with income .
and it turns out that under a income of 60,000 dollars a year , for americans , and this is a very large sample of americans , about 600,000 , but it &apos;s a great representative sample , under a income of 600,000 dollars in the
60,000 .
dk : 60,000 .
60,000 dollars a year , people are unhappy , and they &apos;re getting increasingly unhappy the poorer you will be .
we get an absolutely flat line about this .
i mean , i &apos;ve seen rarely so flat lines .
what happens is obvious that money has not acquired an experience of experience , but that lack of money is certainly accepted to money , and we can measure this misery very , very clearly .
in the sense of the other self , the reminder itself , you get another story .
the more money you earn the more money you make .
it &apos;s not true for emotion .
but danny , in the entire american effort , is about life , freedom , the pursuit of happiness .
if people would take this focus seriously , i mean , it seems to be all on the head , all we believe , for example , in stereotypes and so on .
is there a chance that politicians that the country would generate a lot of how serious the country would take and do based on politics ?
dk : you know , i think it &apos;s appropriate for the role of happiness in politics .
the recognition is slow to be in the united states , no question , but in the u.k. , she &apos;s going to happen right now and in other countries it &apos;s happening right now .
people are realizing that they should be thinking about happiness when they think about politics .
it &apos;s going to take a while , and people will discuss whether they want to study experience , or whether they want to study life review , so we have to have this discussion pretty soon .
how to increase happiness is a very different dependence on how they think and whether they think about the memory of themselves or whether they think about the experience themselves .
this is going to affect politics , i think , in the years .
in the united states , you &apos;re concerned about measuring the experience of the population &apos;s experience .
that &apos;s going to be part of the next one or two decades of the national statistic .
well , it seems to me , this topic , or should at least be the most interesting political debate for the next couple of years .
thank you very much for the invention of behavioral economics .
thank you , danny kunman .
i &apos;m jane mcgonigal . i design video games .
i &apos;ve been developing online games for 10 years , and my goal for the next decade is to make it easy to save the world in reality , how to save them in online games .
i have a plan for this . i want to convince more people , including all of you , more time with playing bigger and good games .
now we spend three billion hours a week online playing online games .
some of you may think , &quot; that &apos;s a lot of time for games . &quot;
maybe something too much time when you think about how many problems we &apos;ve been dealing with in the real world .
but in fact , my research at the institute for the future is exactly the opposite .
three billion hours a week are not nearly enough to solve the most important problems in the world .
in fact , i &apos;m convinced that if we want to survive the next century on this planet , we need to dramatically increase this time .
i &apos;ve calculated that that took time at 21 billion hours of play a week .
this may be a little bit more extreme , so i &apos;m enjoying it so that if we want problems like hunger , poverty , climate change , global conflict and obesity , i think we need to try to play games online for at least
no , i mean it really seriously .
why ? this is a picture that describes pretty much why i think games are so vital for survival of the human species in the future . seriously .
this is a portrait of the photographers phil toleago .
he wanted to capture the feelings in playing , so he was building a camera in front of the players .
this is one of the classic expressions in playing .
if you &apos;re not a player , maybe some of the nuances are going to be in this picture .
you &apos;re probably seeing this sense of urgency , a little scared , but also , very accurate concentration , to solve a really difficult problem .
if you play too , you see some nuances coming up , and the mouth is a sign of optimism . the eyebrows show surprise .
this is a player that stands on the edge of something called a epic sheet .
oh , you know that . ok . all right . so we have some players here .
a epic victory is a result that is so positive that they didn &apos;t know that it was possible at all .
it was almost beyond imagination .
and when you do it , you &apos;re shocked that you &apos;re actually capable of doing something like that . that &apos;s a epic victory .
this player is just front of a epic victory .
and this is what we need to see on millions of faces around the world when we attack the barriers of the next century , the face of those who stand on the edge of a lake of a fish .
well , unfortunately , we &apos;re seeing this face in real life when we &apos;re facing hard problems .
i call it &quot; in life , &quot; i &apos;m bad , and it &apos;s actually my face , you see ? yes ? ok .
this is me , like , &quot; i &apos;m bad &quot; in life .
this is a graffiti in my former home home in berkeley , california , where i studied in my ph.d. why we are better in play than in real life .
that &apos;s a problem that many players have .
we think we &apos;re not as good as playing in reality .
and i don &apos;t mean just less successful , even though that &apos;s heard .
we do more in the world worlds . i mean well in relation to the motivation to do something significant , inspired with each other .
if we &apos;re in a game world , i think many of us are transforming into our best version , every time and immediately helpful the problem to solve the problem as long as you need the failure to try again .
and in reality , if we &apos;re failing on obstacles , we &apos;re often feeling differently .
we feel overwhelmed . we feel defeated . we feel threatened , maybe depressed , frustrated or cynic .
we never have these feelings when we play games , in games they simply don &apos;t .
and that &apos;s what i wanted to study as a graduate student .
why is it impossible in games to think , you couldn &apos;t just reach everything ?
how can we transmit these feelings from playing into reality ?
so i looked at games like the world of warcraft that offers the ideal environment to the social problem solving .
and i &apos;ve discovered some things that make the epic mountains so possible in online worlds .
so , first of all , if you get into one of these online games , especially in world of warcraft , there are a lot of different characters that are ready to trust you a world-living mission , right now .
but not just any mission , but a mission that fits perfectly to your current level in the game , right ?
so make this happen .
you never get a job you can &apos;t solve .
but always on the edge of your ability , you have to get effort . but there &apos;s no unemployment in the world of warcraft .
you don &apos;t sit around and turn around . there &apos;s always something important to do .
and there are plenty of employees .
whereas they go , hundreds of thousands of people working with them to finish their epic mission .
we don &apos;t have that easy in the real life , that feeling that a flowering bunch of employees are ready to be ready .
there &apos;s also this epic story , this inspiring story of why we are and what we have to do .
then we get this whole positive feedback .
you &apos;ve heard of &quot; level up &quot; and &quot; + &quot; + &quot; + &quot; + &quot; + &quot; + &quot; + &quot; + &quot; + .
this constant feedback is not in real life .
when i leave this stage , i don &apos;t have a talk of progress one , and + a crazy idea , + 20 crazy idea .
i don &apos;t get the feedback of that feedback .
so , the problem of cooperation online worlds is so satisfying that it &apos;s so satisfying to stand on the edge of a epidem , that we would rather spend our entire time in these market worlds .
they &apos;re just better than reality .
until today , all the world of warcraft players have spent 5.93 million years trying to solve the virtual problems of laughter .
that &apos;s not necessarily bad .
it sounds like a bad thing .
but to see it in context , 5.93 million years ago , our first primates started to go upright .
so the first upright primate .
ok , so when we talk about how much time we spend with games , it just makes sense when you look at the time in terms of the scale of human development , which is extraordinary .
but also , it turns out , because it turns out that we use all these time to play , actually , to change what we &apos;re capable of .
we develop to collaborate , heartful creatures .
that &apos;s the truth . that &apos;s what i believe .
once you look at this interesting statistic that was published recently by a researcher meneon mellon university , the average young man from today in a country with strong game culture spends 10,000 hours with online play to the 21st of life .
so 10,000 hours is an extremely interesting number for two reasons .
first of all , for children in the united states , 10.80 hours of the total time they spend in school , from the fiveth grade to the degree of high school -- if you never miss .
so here we have a complete parallel path where young people are learning exactly what it means to be a good player like anything else you learn at school .
and maybe some of you have read the new book by malcolm gladwell , &quot; overfly . &quot;
so you know his theory of success , the theory of the success of 10,000 hours .
it &apos;s based on the great research of cognitive science that if we spend 10,000 hours with the painful study of a popular theme to the 21st of life , we become master in it .
we &apos;re getting so good at doing whatever is the most significant people in the world .
so what we have here is a complete generation of young people who are master-players .
so the big question is , what exactly are players doing good ?
because if we could figure that out , we &apos;ve never been able to have human potential before .
we have so many people living in the world at least one hour a day with online players .
these are our master players . 500 million people who are extraordinarily good in &quot; something . &quot;
and in the next decade , we have another billion players that are extraordinarily good in whatever .
if you haven &apos;t heard it yet .
the game industry is developing concentration that can save energy and work on mobile nets , instead of the broadband internet , with players around the world , especially in india , china , brazil online .
you expect an extra billion players in the next decade .
with that , we have a total of 1.5 billion players .
so i started thinking , what is it , what these games are doing to master ?
here are the four things i found . first of all , urgency optimism .
ok , imagine what extreme self-motivation is .
urgency optimism is the desire to be able to do something right now , a hurdle for masters , together with believing that we have an informed hope of success .
players always believe that a epic victory is possible , and it &apos;s always worth trying to do it , right now .
players don &apos;t sit around .
players are poetry in spiders of social nets .
there &apos;s a lot of interesting research that shows that we like people more after we played with them , even though they &apos;ve defeated us .
the reason for that is that there &apos;s a lot of trust to play with someone .
we trust that someone is spending time with us that the rules are being held , that we have the same goal and stay in the game .
so it enables that to play together from bonds , trust and with each other .
as a result of that , we &apos;re building stronger social relationships .
happier productivity . fantastic ! fantastic !
you know , there &apos;s a reason why the average word of warcraft players plays 22 hours a week , sort of a part-time job .
and the reason is that when we play , we &apos;re actually happier to work hard than if we relax or do nothing .
we know that as human beings , we work optimally when we do hard , significant work .
and players are always willing to work hard when they get the right task .
and finally , epic meaning .
players love to become part of an honor of the area of planetary emissions .
here &apos;s a background information to put that in the right light . you know all wikipedia , the largest wikiped in the world .
the second largest wiki of the world , with almost 80,000 drugs is the world of warcraft wiki .
five million people use it every month .
they put more information on the world of warcraft on the internet than about any other subject in the world .
they create a epic story .
they create a epic source of knowledge about the world of warcraft .
ok , so these are four superpowers leading to a single result . players are super-powerful , hopeful individuals .
it &apos;s people who believe they can change the world as individuals .
and the only problem is they believe they can change virtual worlds , but not real .
that &apos;s the problem i try to solve .
edward biblevvum is a volunteer .
his work is awesome . he studies why people spend so much time , energy and money in online worlds .
and he says , &quot; we &apos;re not going to witness from less than an explanation in virtual worlds and online facilities . &quot;
and that &apos;s an economist . so it makes sense .
and he says ...
not like me -- i develop games , i &apos;m a little bit overwhelming .
so he says that actually makes sense , because players can get more than in the real life .
they can make stronger social bonds in games as real life . they get more feedback and rewards in games than they live in real life .
so , he says , well , it &apos;s perfectly logical that players are spending more time in the virtual world than they are in the real life .
i &apos;ll just say that makes sense .
but it &apos;s definitely not optimal .
we need to start to turn the real world into a game .
my inspiration comes from an event that comes back 2,500 years .
there are these ancient cubes , out of printing . you know ?
before these fantastic games games , they gave it to noise .
and these were kind of the first of people developed players .
and if you &apos;re familiar with the works of the old greek historic manifestus , you may know this story . the story of how and why games were invented .
according to blood poems , games were invented , very , very cute games , in the kingdom of lynn , in famine .
intended , there were such famine that the king of lytans decided to be a crazy idea .
people suffered . people fought .
it was an extreme situation . you needed an extreme solution .
so they invented , according to heroes , the cube , the car game and the national strategy , a national strategy . one day you would eat . the next day you would play .
and they would be so much in the cube because games are so fascinating and we surrounded with satisfying , happier productivity that they would forget that there was nothing to eat .
and then the next day you would play . and the next day you would eat .
and according to blood poems , they survived for the last 18 years by eating these famine by eating and playing the next day .
the same way , i think , is playing games today .
we &apos;re putting games in to escape the real world suffering .
we &apos;re putting games in to deal with everything that doesn &apos;t work in the real world , all that is not satisfied in real life , and we get what we need from games .
but that doesn &apos;t have to be the end .
that &apos;s the exciting thing .
the famine didn &apos;t get better after 18 years , so the king decided to put one last doubt .
they shared the kingdom in two crops .
they were playing a cube and they were allowed to break up to a epic adventure .
they left lytuds and went to the search for a new home , and they left as many people as they were going to survive and looked at the rest of a neighborhood where they could thrive .
that sounds crazy , right ?
but latest dna evidence shows that the tribes that later form the roman empire , the same dna as the old lyve .
so scientists recently came to realize that herodd history actually came true .
and geologists found evidence of a global refrigerator that took almost 20 years to explain famine .
so this crazy story could be true .
you might actually have saved her people by playing through games for 18 years , and then they had this intuition , and they learned so much about each other that she would have saved the entire civilization .
so we can do that too .
we &apos;ve been playing warcraft since 1994 .
this was the first degradation in real time the world of warcraft sharks . that was 16 years ago .
they played cuba games for 18 years , we &apos;ve been playing warcraft for 16 years .
i &apos;m saying we &apos;re ready for our own epic game .
so , they sent half their civilization to search for a new world , so i take my 21 billion games a week .
we should transfer that half of us spend an hour with play with play until we solved the world &apos;s problems .
i know you &apos;re going to ask , &quot; how do we solve problems in the real world ? &quot; and that &apos;s the question i &apos;ve determined my work in the last few years at the institute for the future .
we have this banner in our office in palo alto , and it presses how we should understand the future .
we don &apos;t want to try to say the future before .
what we want is to create the future .
we want to imagine the best possible result , and then encourage people to turn this idea into reality .
we put ourselves in the epidemic , and we give people the opportunity to reach them .
i &apos;m going to show you just three games that i &apos;ve designed to try to get people to the epidemic victory in their own future .
this is &quot; world without oil . &quot;
the game is from 2007 .
it &apos;s an online game where you have to overcome a fragment .
the damn thing is invented , but we have enough online content so that it is realistic for them , and you can actually live their real life without oil . so , if you &apos;re in the game , tell us where you &apos;re living , and
we tested this game with 1,700 players in 2007 , and we &apos;ve been accompanied by the last three years .
and i can tell you , it was a changing experience .
nobody wants to change his life because it &apos;s good for the environment , or because we should .
but if you &apos;re in a epic adventure and say , &quot; we &apos;re going out of oil . &quot;
that &apos;s an amazing adventure to go to .
find out how they were going to survive . most of our players have stepped in the game .
so for the next world-saving game , we &apos;ve put a bigger , higher goal than just a scarcity .
we &apos;ve developed the game &quot; superpowers &quot; at the institute for the future .
starting point is the calculation of a supercomputer that people have only 23 years on the planet .
this supercomputer is called &quot; global distributed sensitive system , &quot; of course .
the call of players , at the top of it , we have almost like a &quot; jerry battery &quot; film .
you know jerry bride films , where it gives the &quot; 3d team &quot; . they have the astronauts , the scientists , the extinct , and only together , they can save the world .
but in our play , instead of only five people , we say , everyone is in the diamond team , and it &apos;s our job of creating the future for energy , food , health , security and the future of social justice .
eight,000 players play the game eight weeks .
they found 500 incredibly creative solutions that they can read when they google &quot; superstar . &quot;
and the last game we get on march three . it &apos;s a game in collaboration with the world bank .
if you close the game , you &apos;re going to get the record of social lexicography at the end of 2010 .
we &apos;re working with universities in sub-saharan africa and inviting them to learn social environment .
we have a comic book . we have &quot; level high &quot; for regional understanding , knowledge , sustainability , vision and imperative .
i want to invite you all to share this game with young people all over the world , especially in the developing areas that benefit from presenting their own social entrepreneurs to save the world .
i come to the end .
i want to ask her something .
what do you think happens next ?
we have all these fantastic players , we have games that show us what we can do , but we haven &apos;t saved the real world yet .
well , i hope you agree with me that players are human resources that we can use to work in real life , and that games have a big meaning for change .
we &apos;ve got all of these superpowers , low-cost productivity , the ability to make tight social nets , urgency optimism and the desire for the south meaning .
and i really hope that we play all sorts of important games to survive on this planet another century .
and i hope you &apos;ll design these games and play with me .
so when i look at the next decade , i &apos;m sure of two things that we can create every unimaginable future , and we can play all kinds of games .
so i say , let the world-changing games begin !
thank you .
i &apos;d like to tell you something about a couple of months ago in the writing of italian wired .
i always took my synonymous dictionary in writing , but i was done with the design of the text , and i realized that i &apos;ve never suggested in my life what the word &quot; disabled &quot; really means .
i &apos;ll read you the posture .
&quot; disabled , &quot; adventure : &quot; negotiating , helpless , useless , devastated , rejective , vulnerable , accelerate , devoted , executed , executed , scary , crucially , crucial ,
goodtoe : healthy , strong , powerful .
and i read this list of a friend of mine , and i had to laugh , it was so ridiculous , but i was only going to say , &quot; and couldn &apos;t keep on reading , and i had to stop reading , and just
of course , this was an extended , old synonymous dictionary , and i just thought the copy must be pretty old .
but in fact , it was a copy of the early &apos; 80s , when i just started with elementary school and started building my own self-esteem outside of my family environment and forming in terms of other children and the rest of me around
and god , thank god , i didn &apos;t use synonymous dictionary at that time .
if i would take this contribution seriously , i would be born in a world that someone like me would perceive as a person whose life can be positively beneficial , but today i &apos;m going to be celebrated for opportunities and adventures that
so i immediately picked up the online copy of 2009 , and i expected me to have a discussion here .
here &apos;s the current version of this component .
unfortunately , it &apos;s not much better .
in particular , my last two words in &quot; near totony &quot; and &quot; healthy &quot; and &quot; healthy . &quot;
but it &apos;s not just about words .
it &apos;s about what we think about the people we describe with these words .
it &apos;s about the values that are in these words , and how we construct these values .
our language changes our thinking and how we see the world and the people around us .
many ancient societies , including the greeks and the romans , really believed that the language language of a fox has a big force , because what you &apos;re talking about , as well as manifest .
so what do we actually want to manipulate -- an disabled people or a powerful person ?
call it a person in 2005 as a child , could be enough to shake them and give them ideas .
wouldn &apos;t it be beautiful to open doors ?
a person who has opened for me doors was my pediatrician dung institute in wilmton in redwoods .
it &apos;s called dr. pizza . an italian american , his name , as you can imagine , most americans couldn &apos;t talk correct , so he was always called dr. p.
and dr. p. was always very colorful flying , and was just designed for children .
i found the time i spent in this hospital , just great -- to my physical therapy .
i had to seem to get one set of exercise in the end of this big , elastic economy -- in different colors -- you know , to build my leg muscle , and i hated these boxes more than anything else . i hated them
and imagine , even as a five-year-old kid with dr. p. neanderth , i tried to stop these practices , dill without success .
and one day he looked at me at one of my practices -- these practices were just tiring and naked -- and he said to me , &quot; wow , aimee , you &apos;re such a powerful , powerful and young girl , you &apos;re going
and if you can do it , i give you a hundred dollars . &quot;
so , of course , this was just a simple trick of dr. p. so i do the practice that i didn &apos;t want to do , with the impression that richer five-year-old girl in the classroom will actually get me to see my daily
and i &apos;m wondering how much his vision of my vision as a powerful and powerful young girl have shaped my self-interest and could imagine seeing me as one nature of very powerful , powerful and atlective people .
this is just one example of how adults can deliver the imagination of a child &apos;s imagination .
but as the examples of synonymous dictionaries prove to us , our language doesn &apos;t give us a room to imagine what we all wish about : enable everybody to see themselves as a powerful person .
our language disappears to the social changes behind that in many cases by technological change .
so , of course , from the medical point of view , my legs , the laser surgery for visually impaired , branches from titan and artificial hills for old bodies that allow people to use all their possibilities and to develop their natural
so , perhaps this technological change is clear , because ever that there &apos;s always been a different truth , which is that every human human society can give something very special and very powerful , and that the human ability is to adapt , our biggest
so the human ability to adapt -- this is an interesting story , because people always ask me to tell me about how i go to comfort , and i &apos;m going to give you a little bit of a commitment : that sentence never missed
and this sentence from the deal with wireless lives from the idea that success or happiness depends on the challenge , without being implemented by the associated experience , as if my life was so successful , because i could escape the possible way of
but the truth is that we &apos;re changing . of course we &apos;re shaped by the challenge , whether it &apos;s physically , emotionally or even both .
and i claim that that &apos;s good .
now , tricky is not an obstacle that we need to wave up to get better with our lives .
so withless is just to our lives .
and i tend to see withless than my shadow .
and sometimes i realize that he &apos;s very present , sometimes he &apos;s hard to see , but he &apos;s all over the place .
and i don &apos;t want to have the impact in any way or the effect of the struggle of a human being .
there are wires in life and challenges , and they &apos;re just all the real realities , and each person is doing it differently , but the question is not whether we &apos;re dealing with a wide or not , but how we get here .
so we &apos;re not just responsible for preserving the people that we love to preserve flexible , but they &apos;re also prepared to get out of it .
and we don &apos;t really think of our children if we give them the feeling that they can &apos;t adapt .
you &apos;ve got two things to separate : to be the medical fact , amputated and to the other , the social opinion of whether i &apos;m disabled or not .
and to be honest , the only real and remaining disability that i had to relate to is that the world is constantly mimicking me with these definitions .
in our wish , protecting people who are heart and paying them the cold , hard truth about their medical projections , or providing a prediction to the quality of life that they expect , we have to adapt that we don &apos;t make the stone
maybe that &apos;s right now that just looks at what &apos;s broken in a broken way , and how we repair it , for each individual disability than pathology itself .
if we don &apos;t treat a human being holistically , and don &apos;t perceive all of its forces and possibilities and recognize and recognize , in addition to the natural struggle you may have to lead , another disease .
we deceive a person who has value for our society .
so we have to look beyond the patology and focus on all the parts of the human opportunity .
but the most important thing is , between perception of our insurance and our great inventors , a connection .
we shouldn &apos;t be able to judge these requirements or deny them , we shouldn &apos;t try to avoid them , yet we should reverse them under the carpet , but it &apos;s about seeing opportunities in the wires .
it may be more important to imagine that we don &apos;t have to overcome tricky , but we &apos;re open for it , to embrace them on the sacrifice to use a struggle , and maybe even dance with it .
and maybe we can do that , wideless than something natural , stimulus and useful to see , and we don &apos;t feel like that through your presence anymore .
this year , we celebrated the 200 . birthday of charles darwin , and when he wrote about evolution 150 years ago , darwin has shown in my eyes , in my eyes , to something very true in the human character .
i would write it like this : not surviving the strongest of his species , and not the most clever of his species , but the one who can best adapt change .
conflicts come from creativity .
not only from darwin &apos;s work , we know that the ability of people to survive and flourishing , from the struggle of the human mind , is determined by conflict .
so again , change and adaptation are the great skills of human beings .
and maybe we just know what wood we are cut when we &apos;re really being tested .
maybe that &apos;s the point of comfort , a perception of me , a sense of our own power .
we can give ourselves something like this .
we can give wires a new meaning that goes beyond severe times .
maybe we can see with as change .
well , troubles are a change that we haven &apos;t yet adapted to .
i think the biggest damage we &apos;ve added ourselves is to believe that we should be normal .
in fact , who is normal ?
there is no normal .
there &apos;s the usual . the typical . but not the normal thing , and would you really want to learn these poor , grand person , if you really gave it ?
i don &apos;t think so .
it would be great if we could put this paradigm on the norm to another of the possibilities or the strength to make it even a little bit more dangerous , so we can release the forces of very many children , and invite them
anthropologists found out that we have always asked people from the members of our society to be useful and afford a contribution .
there &apos;s evidence that the neanderthals , 60,000 years ago , had older people and people with severe physical injuries , and perhaps that happened because the life experience in the survivor of these people was valuable for society .
they didn &apos;t look at these people as breaks and useless ; they were treated as something special and valuable .
so a couple of years ago , i went to the town where i grew up in a food market in this red zone in the north zone in the north of pennsylvania , and i was standing in front of a scott tomato
it was summer and i had shortage .
and i hear a guy saying , &quot; well , if that &apos;s not aimee mullins . &quot;
and i turn around and see this elderly man . i had no idea who he is .
and i said , &quot; excuse me , sir , we know ? i can &apos;t remember them . &quot;
and he said , &quot; well , you can &apos;t remember me .
when i first saw her , i got her out of her mother &apos;s belly .
oh , so that .
and of course , it made click .
this was dr. kean , a man i knew only about narratives of my mother over this day , because i was , of course , two weeks at my birthday .
the president for precision diagnostics of my mother was in vacation , and so my parents knew the man who brought me to the world at all .
and because i was born without the water legs , and my feet had begun after you , and i just had a few toes on this and some toes at the other foot , and this stranger had to bring out the bad news .
he said to me , &quot; i had to tell your parents that you &apos;re never going to be running , and never as moving as other children or you might never have been able to have an independent life , and they &apos;ve just been just lying me
in fact , i found that he had collected newspapers of my entire childhood , whether i had won in a book of a book of the second class , whether i was running with the phrases on hallucinates to hallucinates , whether i
and he called this part of his class , the x factor , the potential of human will .
you can simply not emphasize how much of this factor can be for the quality of life .
and dr. kean passed on , he said , &quot; i &apos;ve learned that children , if they don &apos;t get something else always , and even if they give children a little bit of support , when they leave children themselves , children can get a lot
see dr. kean changed his thinking .
he understood that medical diagnostics , and how someone deals with it , is two different things .
and also , i &apos;ve changed my thinking over the course of 15 years , if i had asked my prostheses against legs of meat and bones , i wouldn &apos;t have been killing a second .
i really wanted to act normal at the time .
if you ask me that , i &apos;m not so sure .
and this happened because i &apos;ve experienced something with my legs , and not despite those experiences .
and maybe this change could happen because i &apos;m so many people who have opened doors , instead of encountering people who would confirm me or wanted to give me an idea .
see , it really takes one person who shows you how to manipulate their forces , and they &apos;re through .
if you allow somebody to activate their own internal forces -- the human mind is so relevant -- if you can do that , and for someone in a critical moment , you &apos;re a very good teacher for those people .
they teach them to open doors .
the actual meaning of the word &quot; imagination &quot; is rooted in the word &quot; sance . &quot;
it means making something that is in a way to flourish the potential .
again , what potential do we want to call off ?
in the 1960s , a case was done in britain , and at the time , the gymnars were transformed in art .
they call this &quot; street trials &quot; in the u.s. we call it &quot; tracks . &quot;
students are divided to notes .
and the a student will check a little bit harder , get the better teachers and so on .
and then they &apos;ve given students a &quot; supreme night , &quot; given the note , &quot; very good , &quot; and they told them they were very clever , and after those three months they really wrote one .
and of course , it breaks you to hear the heart that the individual students were told , they were just enough .
and that &apos;s exactly how it was three months .
but just those who still were in school -- apart from the students who had thrown the school .
the most important thing about this study was that the teachers were not going to be .
the teachers didn &apos;t know something was changed .
they were just told that are the one students , and these are the students who are suppliing to the note , and they &apos;ve taught them something and treated them .
the only real disability is a broken mind that was broken , doesn &apos;t have hope anymore . it doesn &apos;t have any more of our natural , childish curiosity and our innate capacity of imagination .
but if we manage to support the human mind , keep trying to hope , self-assembly and other people around them , to be curious and diagnostic , then we put our forces really positive .
if a mind has about these qualities , we can create a new reality and new performance form .
i &apos;d like to end with a poem that &apos;s been written by a persian poet called harness in the 14th century , and i told my friend jacques bobo , and the poem is known by the god that knows only four
come on , dance with me . thank you .
how would you want to be better than you are right now ?
assuming , i said , through a few changes of genes , a better memory could have -- more precise , more precise , faster .
or would you like to be harder , stronger , have more power .
would you like to get more attractive and more confident ?
how about living longer at good health ?
or maybe you &apos;re one of those who has always sequenced for more creativity .
which would you like most ?
which would you like to have if you could only have one ?
creativity .
how many people would choose creativity ?
raise your hands . let me see .
a couple . probably about as many as there are creative people here .
that &apos;s very good .
how many would decide for good memory ?
a couple more .
how about fitness ?
a few less .
what about longevity ?
ah , the majority . i like to read that as a doctor .
if you could only have one of them , it would be a very different world .
is it all just invitation ?
or is it possible ?
evolution has been an intended subject here at the ted conference , but today i want to give you the subject of a doctor &apos;s mind .
the great geneticist in the 20th century , t.g. thumb , who was a commercial in the russian orthodox church , wrote once a paper called &quot; nothing in biology doesn &apos;t make sense except in the origin of evolution . &quot;
now , if you &apos;re one of those who is not accepting the evidence for biological evolution , this would be a very good time to turn your hungry , take your personal communication message -- and maybe you can take a look at kathryn
but if you accept biological evolution , you think this is just about the past , or is it about the future ?
is it more hungry for other people or is it also us ?
this is another glimpse of the tree of life .
in this picture , i have a bush as a center of the prevention in all directions , because if you look at the edges of the life of life , all existing specific people in the top of these two have had success : they
the human part of this bush , far at the end , is what we &apos;re most interested in .
we are two or eight million years ago to modern chimpanzees .
in that period of time , maybe 20 or 25 different specials of hominids .
some came and left .
we &apos;ve been here for about 130,000 years .
it seems like we &apos;re quite remote out of the other parts of life , but actually most of the basic mechanisms are pretty much the basic mechanisms of our cells .
is it clear that we can take advantage of it and regulate the mechanisms of a shared bacteria to produce the protein of the human insulin , which is used to treat diplomat ?
this is not like human insulin ; this is the same protein that is chemically distinct from what comes out of the pancreatic .
and when we talk about bacteria , are you aware that every one of us in our gut leads to the rest of our bacteria ?
maybe 10 times so many .
i mean , think if antonio damasio asks your own image , do you think about the bacteria ?
our gut is a wonderful robotic environment for these bacteria .
it &apos;s warm , it &apos;s dark , it &apos;s a broad , it &apos;s very comfortable .
and you &apos;re going to give them all nutrients that they could only wish without effort .
it &apos;s actually a slightly way for bacteria , with the most precious interruption of unintended , judgment for the process .
but otherwise , they are a wonderful environment for these bacteria , just like they are important for their lives .
they help food nutrients , and they protect them against certain diseases .
but what will come in the future ?
are we in some kind of evolutionary equilibrium form of a species ?
or are we definitely going to be something else -- something that may even be adapted to the environment better ?
so let &apos;s go back to the time of the big bang , 14 trillion years ago -- the earth , the solar system , about four and a half billion years ago -- the first signs of living beings , maybe three to four billion years
in this vast unified symphony of the universe , life on earth is just preferred , the animal kingdom , like a single tax ; and human life , a small disorder .
we did .
this also represents the self-assembly of this speech , so i hope , d would enjoy it .
now , when i was a neuron at college , i had my first biology class .
i was fascinated by the elegance and beauty of biology .
i fell in love with the power of evolution , and i made something very basic : in most of the existence of life in individual organisms , every cell , and all the genetic information of the cell is continued in both daughter cells .
but at the time , as the more expensive organisms came up , things started to change .
sexual reproduction is in the picture .
and most importantly , with the introduction of sexual reproduction , which passes the genome , the rest of the body becomes essential .
in fact , you could say that the inevitability of the death of our bodies in evolution occurs at the same moment as sexual reproduction .
now i &apos;ve got to say , if i was a college student , i thought , okay , sex / death , sex / death , death for sex -- it seemed quite sensible to the time , but with every year , it &apos;s been to
i &apos;ve come to understand the feelings of george burns in las vegas his show in the &apos; 90s .
and one night , there &apos;s a map on his hotel room .
he opens the door .
before him , a beautifully packed dress show .
she looks at him and says , &quot; i &apos;m here for supersex . &quot;
&quot; that &apos;s wonderful , &quot; george says , &quot; i &apos;m going to take the soup . &quot;
i came to the realization as a doctor that i was working on a goal that was different than the goal of evolution -- not necessarily contradictory , just different .
i tried to preserve the body .
i wanted to keep ourselves healthy .
i wanted to rebuild health after a disease .
i wanted us to be a long and healthy life .
evolution is all about providing the genome to the next generation , adaptation and survival generation generation .
from an evolutionary point of view , you and i are developing like booster rockets to send the genetic frank to the next level of the light , and then let them fall into the ocean .
i think we would all get the mood that the woody everybody understood to expression when he said , &quot; i don &apos;t want to get to immortality through my work .
i want to do it by not dying . &quot;
evolution is not necessarily preferred to prefer the longest life .
it doesn &apos;t necessarily privilege the biggest , the strongest or the fastest , and not even the smartest .
evolution privileged the creatures that are best at their environment .
it &apos;s just the test of survival and success .
on the bottom of the ocean , bacteria are present , and by doing the hot steam , if fish were there , there would be vacuum cooked fish , yet they &apos;ve been able to make it a living environment for themselves .
so , what does that mean when we look back at what &apos;s happening in evolution , and how we think about the place of people in evolution , and especially like we look into the next phase , i would say there &apos;s a number of
the first is that we &apos;re not going to develop .
we &apos;ve reached some kind of balance .
and the reason for that would be that it &apos;s first by medicine to get a lot of genes that would have been chosen and have been removed from the population .
and second , we as a species have concentrated our environment so that we &apos;ve managed to adapt to us right now , and we adapt to them .
and by the way , we migrate and circulate and we measure so much that they can &apos;t say that isolation is necessary , for evolution to occur .
a second possibility is that it becomes an evolution of the traditional way , of course , in the forces of nature .
and the argument here , here is that the wheels of evolution are slowly cool , but they are proportional .
and as far as the isolation comes to , as a species of distant planets , there will be isolation and changes of the environment that could make evolution naturally natural .
but there is a third possibility , a declining , intriguing and terrifying opportunity .
i call it neano-evolution -- the new development that &apos;s not just natural , but led and decided of us as individual in the decisions we make .
now , how could that happen ?
how could it be possible that we do this ?
let &apos;s start by looking at reality that people today , in some cultures , make decisions about their extensions .
they are , in some cultures , choice , to have more men than women .
it &apos;s not necessarily good for society , but it &apos;s what the individual and the family choose .
so think if it &apos;s not just possible to choose the gender of your child , but also contain genetic adaptations on the body to heal the disease and prevent the disease .
what if you could make the genetic changes to eliminate diabetes or alzheimer &apos;s disease or eliminate the risk of cancer risk or stroke ?
would you not want it to make these changes in their genes ?
if we predict , these kinds of changes will be increasingly possible .
the human genome project started in 1990 and it took 13 years .
it cost 2.7 billion dollars .
the next year it finished in 2004 , they could do the same for 20 million dollars in dal to four months .
today , you can get a sequence of three billion base pairs of the human genome to a price of about 20,000 and in the room of about a week .
it won &apos;t take long until reality is going to be the 1,000 dollars of human genomes , and it &apos;s going to be available to everybody .
so a week ago , the national academy of engineering was the wiper prize for francis arnold and memory , two scientists that developed independence in the natural process of working faster , working faster and having desired proteins in a more efficient way
a couple of years ago , the reader prize of scientist saya yahaka was in his research for his research in which he took an adult pipeline , a broadcast , and through the manipulation of only four genes , to bring
these changes are in the coming .
the same technology that produces human insulin in bacteria can make viruses that are not just protection before themselves , but can serve the immunity to other viruses .
whether you believe it or not , it &apos;s an experimental study in the gang with vaccine against influenza that &apos;s been built into the cells of a box .
can you imagine something good that comes from taboo ?
this is all reality , and in the future , it &apos;s going to be much more possible .
so imagine just two other little changes .
you can change the cells in your body , but what if you could change the cells of your way ?
what if you could change the sperm and egyptians or the fresh frontiers of eggs to give their children a better chance for a healthy life -- eliminating diabetes , to reduce the risk of cancer ?
who doesn &apos;t want healthier children ?
and then the analytical technology , the same motor of science that can allow the changes to prevent disease , could also enable us to adopt the power of superpower , hyper-production -- the better memory .
why don &apos;t you have the impact of a ken of jewish hunt , especially if you can extend it to the next generation of the watson machine ?
why not have fast muscle fibers that will allow them to run faster and longer ?
why no longer live ?
these are going to be distinct .
and when we &apos;re at a place where we can pass it on to the next generation , and we can adopt the attributes that we want , we &apos;re going to be transformed by old-fashioned evolution to net-evolution .
we &apos;re going to have a process that probably takes 100,000 years , and we can compromise it for a thousand years -- and maybe for the next 100 years .
these are decisions with which your grandchildren , or their grandchildren , must be dealing with .
are we using these decisions a society that is better , the more successful that is more friendly ?
or will we choose selectively different attacks that we want to have for some of us and not for others ?
are we going to make society form more boring and more unprecedented and more robust ?
these are the kinds of questions that we need to be facing .
and the deepest of all , are we ever going to be able to develop wisdom and master wisdom that we &apos;re going to need to make these decisions ?
the good as you might think in bad , and before you might think , are going to be these decisions .
thank you .
i want you to imagine something that gives you a tragic robot that gives you human skills , or another one , the wheelchair , helps to stand up and get up .
we &apos;re calling these robots in berkeley bicycles these robots .
they &apos;re not anything other than something you put in the morning and give them extra strength to them and increase their speed further and help them keep their balance .
this is actually the real mergeance of human and machine .
but not only that -- it &apos;s merging and connecting to the universe and other devices out there .
it &apos;s not just a crazy idea .
now , to show you what we &apos;re working on , we start talking about the american soldiers that carry about 100 pounds on its back , and it &apos;s the demand that they should wear more equipment .
now , of course , this leads to some major complications -- interinferences , 30 percent of it -- chronic interinferences .
so we thought we would embrace this challenge and create an execution that would help to deal with this problem .
so let me introduce you to god -- or the human universal loan carriac .
soldier : with the horizon skeleton , i can wear 200 pounds of good terrain for many hours .
his flexible design allows you to get deep to war and warm and highly active movements .
it feels what i want to do where i want to go and then raise my strength and extension .
we are so far in presenting this device , this new exo aloscole that year .
so it &apos;s true .
so let &apos;s take a look at the wheelchair of the wheelchair , something that i &apos;m particularly passionate about .
there are 68 million people who are appreciating the world in the wheelchair .
that &apos;s about one percent of the entire population .
and that is actually a conservative estimate .
we &apos;re often talking about very young people with spinal cord injuries , which in the hotel time of their life -- 2020 , 30 , 40s -- was hit by fate and the wheelchair is the only option .
but it &apos;s also about aging population , which is multiplying number .
and pretty much the only option -- when it comes to a brain bag , or other complications -- is the wheelchair .
and so it &apos;s been 500 years since it &apos;s been 500 years , as i have to say , very successful introduction .
so we thought we could start to write a completely new chapter in mobility .
so let me introduce you to eleges that will be carried by amanda boxing 19 years ago a spinal cord injury , which has been the result that she couldn &apos;t run anymore for 19 years and until now .
thank you .
as i said , amanda wears our elegance .
it has sensors .
his completely non-invasive sensors in the crutches , sending signals back to our boardboard computers , which is here on their back .
here &apos;s battery packaging , the engine of motor is on its hills , just like on your bars that move you forward in this pretty much , and very natural gasoline .
i was 24 years old , and in the courtyard , as a monitoring pore tree during a sketch , i was paralyzed by a sketch .
in the fraction of a second , i lost every feeling and every movement below my beck .
and not long after that , a doctor &apos;s going to go to my hospital , and he said , &quot; amanda , you &apos;ll never go again . &quot;
and that was 19 years ago .
he steel every low hope from my consciousness .
adaptive technologies have been allowed me to learn to drive again , to climb , and even drive with the hands of the hands .
but nothing was invented that would let me go again until now .
thank you .
as you can see , we have the technology , we have the platforms to meet and discuss with them .
it &apos;s in our hands , and we have the whole potential here to change life from future generations -- not just for the soldiers , or for amanda here and all wheelchair , but all the wheelchair .
thank you .
at home in new york , i &apos;m boss of the development department of a nonprofit organization called robin hood .
if i don &apos;t fight poverty , i &apos;m going to fight as a firefighter man at a volunteer revenue with a volunteer .
well , in our city where volunteers supported a high-digit profession , you have to be pretty early at the car station to be able to mit .
i remember my first fire .
i was the second volunteer at the car station , so i was able to have pretty good opportunities in it .
but it was still a competition against the other volunteers to reach the responsible main man and figure out what our tasks would be .
when i found the main man , he was just in a very serious conversation with the household ownership who certainly had one of the worst days of her life .
it was in the middle of the night , and she was standing in the sleep and broad under a screen outside of a screen , while her house stood in flames .
the other volunteer that got out of front of me -- call him lex luther -- got the main man first and was asked to go to the house and save the dog of house ownership .
the dog ! i was lost before yesterday .
there was any lawyer or commitment , which was now for the rest of his life that people could tell people that he went into a burning house to save a living , only because it was five seconds faster than me .
now , i was the next .
the main man woke me up .
he said , &quot; beach , you have to go to the house .
you &apos;ve got to go up where fire goes over , and you have to get this woman to get some shoes . &quot;
i swear .
well , not exactly what i was hoping to do , but i went down -- the stairs up , the flu up , to the real firefighters , which at this point , was pretty much done with the deroom in the bedroom to get
i know what you &apos;re thinking , but i &apos;m not a hero .
i went back to the bottom of my prey , where i met my wife &apos;s door at the door of my celebration and the beloved dog .
we put our judgments out to the household , where , not surprisingly , got a lot more attention than mine .
a few weeks later , the fire wake received a letter of the house ownership , where they sat down for the boring effort at saving their house .
one of the most valued associations : somebody had even brought her some shoes .
and both in my career at robbin hood , as a volunteer of fireman , i &apos;m witness of generosity and kindness at great scale , but i also see action of the neighbor and the courage of individuals .
and you know what i learned ?
they &apos;re all important .
so if i look around in this room and see people who have either achieved a remarkable success or there , i want to offer that memory : don &apos;t wait .
don &apos;t wait to make a difference in the lives of another , until they &apos;ve reached their first million .
if you have something , you &apos;ll give it now .
if you operate in a contradiction , you open up a park in the neighborhood .
be a mentor .
not every day will give us an opportunity to save a person &apos;s life , but every day gives us the opportunity to change one .
so put them on ; save the shoes .
thank you .
bruno guishai : mark , mark , come back .
thank you .
i &apos;m just coming back from a community that knows the secret of humanity &apos;s persistence .
a place where women are leading the tues with sex &apos; hello , and the game determines the day -- where fun is a serious issue .
and no , it &apos;s not burnt you or san francisco .
ladies and gentlemen , their familiarity .
this is the world of wild bonobos in the forest of congo .
bonobos are together with chimpanzees with chimpanzees related to our neighborhoods .
that means we have a common ancestor , an evolutionary grandmother that lived about six million years ago .
well , chimpanzees are known for their aggressive .
but unfortunately , we &apos;ve overcome this aspect in narrative in human evolution .
but bonobos show us the other side of the packil .
while chimpanzees are led by great , fearful , kerry , the bonobo company will lead by empathy female females .
they really made this up , because that leads to an extraordinary torture society that was not observed in the deadly violence .
but unfortunately , bonobos are most known among the primates .
they live in the depths of the economy of the economy , and the observation is just hard for observation .
congo is a paradox -- a country of extraordinary biodiversity and beauty , but also the heart of the darkness itself -- the separation of a violent disorder that has been killed for decades and so many lives like the first world war .
it doesn &apos;t surprise that this destruction also threatens the survival of the bonobos .
meat and the decline of the tree of the tree is that you could not even fill a stadium with the burn bonobo -- and even we &apos;re not sure to be honest .
and yet , in this country of violence and chaos , you can hear a burnt laughter that the trees shatter .
who are these related ?
we know them as &quot; love instead of war , because they have common , also bisexual sex , with participation , and rules such as conflicts and social issues .
i &apos;m not saying that would be the answer to all the humanitarian problems -- because the bonobos live from the bonobos of the wiam sahara .
bonobos -- like people -- love playing their lives for long .
play doesn &apos;t just mean children &apos;s games .
for us , and it &apos;s a fundamental game for connection to relationships and care of tolerance .
and we learn trust and the rules of the game .
play increases creativity and resilience , and it &apos;s all about generating diversity -- diversity of interactions , diversity of behaviors , diversity of connections .
and if you look at bonobos in the game , you see the evolutionary origins of human lenses , dance and rituals .
play is the suffering that joins us .
well , i don &apos;t know how they play , but i want to show you some unique footage straight out of the wild .
first of all , a balloon in bonobo -- and i don &apos;t think of football .
so here we see a young female and males in one direction .
look at what she does .
that could be the evolutionary origin , &quot; she packs him with the eggs . &quot;
just that i think it &apos;s more like that , isn &apos;t it .
yeah !
so sex games are spread , both in bonobos and people .
and this video is really interesting because it shows -- and this video is really interesting , because it shows the amount of information that you get to the game -- like the shoots -- and also , how the game is demanding both trust as well as
but the game is a form of form .
play is a form of form , and it can take many forms that some people are quietly quiet , fantastic , curious -- perhaps to discover the assumptions .
and i want to show you , this is full , a young female , and she plays peacefully with water .
i think just like you are playing alone , we sometimes play boundaries of our inner and outer worlds .
and it &apos;s this playful curiosity that makes us research and interacting and interacting , and the unexpected links that we form are the actual food of creativity .
this is just a little proxy on the glimpse that bonobos give us into our past and present .
but you also see a secret for our future , a future where we have to adapt to the challenges of the challenges , by greater creativity and print .
the secret is that the game is the key to these skills .
in other words , play is our adaptation .
to make us succeed in a unable world , we need to play .
but are we going to make the best of our playmark ?
play is not silly .
it &apos;s essential .
for bonobos and people equally , life is not from teeth and claws alone .
just when it doesn &apos;t seem appropriately appropriate , it may be the most needed .
and therefore , my primates , let &apos;s embrace this gift of evolution and play together , while we &apos;re doing creativity , the camera and the wonder .
thank you .
i want you to imagine two pairs , in the middle of 1979 , on the exact same day , every moment , every one of them is a baby -- okay .
so two pairs , everyone &apos;s doing a baby .
now , i don &apos;t want you to have a lot of time to imagine the stuff , because if you introduce the stuff that &apos;s all the time , you won &apos;t listen to me .
just imagine that for a moment .
and in this scenario , you imagine that in a case the sperm is wearing a y chocolate that meets the x chromosome of the egcell .
and in the other case , the sperm is a x chromosome that meets the x chromosome of the egcell .
both of them are more sustainable , both accepted .
we &apos;re still coming back to these people later .
i &apos;ve been on most of my practices in most of my work .
under a hat i &apos;m concerned with the story of anatomy .
i went to historian , and in this case , i study how people went around with anatomy -- the human body , animal body -- how they went through body quarters with body quarters , with bodies , how they thought about body .
the other hat that i &apos;ve been carrying at my work is the activist , as a patient monitoring -- or , as i sometimes say , as an impatient lawyer -- of people who are the patients of doctors .
in this case , i &apos;ve been working with people , the bodies , having the social norms question .
so , for example , i worked with people who are siamian twins , two people in a body .
i worked with people with schemes -- so people who were smaller than usual .
and very often , i &apos;ve worked with intersexal people whose gender is attractive -- so people who don &apos;t have the average male or female body .
and as a general term , we can use the word intersexuality .
intersexuality is in many different forms .
i &apos;m just going to give you a couple of examples of the possible types of features that are not the male or female standard .
in a case , maybe you have someone with a xy chromosome , and the ray gene of the y choosso makes the prototype that we &apos;ve all got mental style to come up with .
and that &apos;s why the pants in the fossil stage give testosterone .
but because this individual is missing the receptors to see the testosterone , the body doesn &apos;t respond to testosterone .
and this is called androler defect .
so a lot of testosterone , but no response to that .
as a consequence , the body develops more of the fabulous female course .
when the child is born , she looks like a girl .
she &apos;s a girl . she &apos;s raised as a girl .
but it &apos;s mostly until you reach puberty and grow your breasts and develop , but you don &apos;t get your period , until someone comes to this , it &apos;s slightly different here .
and they make a couple of tests and find out that instead of breaking out and uterus , they &apos;re actually wearing touch , and they have y chromosome .
it &apos;s important to understand that you could think this person for actually male , but they &apos;re not really .
women , like men , have something called adventure fake .
they are in the back part of the body .
and the next kidney represents androgenes , which are virginized hormones .
most women , like me -- i think i &apos;ll be a typical woman -- i don &apos;t know my actual chromosomes , but i think i probably have the typical -- most women like me actually talk to androgenes .
we produce androves and we talk to androgenes .
the result is that someone like me actually has a brain that was more android than a woman who was born with ships , and has an andropere bug .
so gender is really complicated ; it &apos;s not just in the middle of the spectrum of gender -- in a sense , you can be distributed across the bandwidth .
another example : a couple of years ago , i received the call of a 19 year-old man who was born as a boy , he had a girlfriend , had sex with his girlfriend , lived as a man , and he had just
he had an extreme form of an innate cellular hypothermia .
he has xx chromosome , and in the womb , his sidekid was so strong that they basically created a male hormone environment .
and as a consequence , his genital was male , his brain was exposed to the typical male part of the hormone .
and when he was born , he looked like a boy -- nobody knew something .
and only when he became 19 years old , he got enough medical problems , in fact , because he entered that , that the doctors found out that he was inside of female .
okay , just a quick example of a variation of intersexuality .
some people with xx chromosomes , they develop something called ovotis , which is interrupted by shield tissue .
we don &apos;t know exactly why this is happening .
so gender can enter into many different varieties .
the reason why children with this kind of body -- whether it &apos;s zooming or siamrian twins , is intersexally -- of surgeons often adapt to the norm , isn &apos;t because this would be for their physical health .
in many cases these people are totally healthy .
the reason why they &apos;re often going to have different types of surgical intervention is because they threaten our social categories .
and typically , our system is based on the idea that a certain anatomical exchange with a specific identity .
so we have the concept that a woman is to be a female identity , to be a black person , is pretending to have an african anatomy in terms of their own history .
so we have this terribly simplified idea .
and when we &apos;re faced with a body that is actually something very different to us , it confuses us to look at these categories .
so in our culture , we have a lot of romantic ideas about individualism .
and our nation is really based on a very romantic concept of individualism .
now you can imagine how amazing it is when children are born that are two people in a body .
where i had experienced most of the excitement in the last time , the south african advance of classster sester semiy was last year that the gender was asked in question in berlin in berlin .
a lot of journalists call me the question , &quot; what are you going to do that tells us whether cster semiy is female or male ? &quot;
and i had to explain to journalists that there &apos;s no test .
we now know that gender is complicated enough that we have to admit that nature doesn &apos;t have a line between male and female , or between male and intersexal and intersexal , demonstrating the line as of course .
so we have a situation , where the further our science advances , we have to say that these categories that we were holding for robust anatomic categories which made very simple attacks to create permanent identities , much more prosperous
and it &apos;s not just about gender .
it &apos;s also in terms of what turns out to be much more complicated than our monument .
in our view , we got into all sorts of uncomfortable areas .
so , for example , we &apos;re coming to the fact that we have at least 95 percent of our dna with chimpanzees .
what are we going to start with with the fact that we &apos;re only different from a few nuclear stages ?
as we push our science further and further , we get increasingly into a zone of the discomfort , where we have to recognize that the simulating categories that we had probably been too simplistic .
we see this in all sorts of areas of human life .
one of the areas where we see this in action , in our today &apos;s culture , in today &apos;s united states , is the struggle over the beginning and the end of life .
we have difficult conversations about what a body is becoming for people , so that he has another right as the fetal life .
we have very difficult conversations today -- maybe not as public as medicine -- about the question when someone is dead .
our ancestors used to have never been so hard to fight when someone was dead .
you &apos;ve just held a feather under the nose , and when it moved , they haven &apos;t buried them yet .
if she didn &apos;t move anymore , she &apos;s buried them .
but today , we are in a situation where we &apos;re going to take people &apos;s vital organs and reproduce them other people .
and as a result , we &apos;re starting to fight the really hard question when someone is dead , and that brings us into a really difficult situation where we have no longer so simple categories as we used to .
now you might think that all of the categories of categories would make someone really happy .
i &apos;m political programs , i defend people with unusual bodies , but i have to admit , it makes me nervous .
now understanding that these categories are really much more insecure than we thought , i &apos;m excited about it .
and it makes me feel so excited about terms of democracy .
so to tell you about this epiphany , i have to know that i &apos;m a big fan of greenest fathers .
i know they were massive , i know they were sexists , but they were great .
i think they were such a borer and very strong , and so radical , where they were doing me every couple of years in reception , and it &apos;s not because of the music that &apos;s absolutely forgotten .
it &apos;s because of what &apos;s happened in 1776 with the greenest fathers .
the greenest fathers were from my view of the original anatomic activists , and that &apos;s why .
what they proved was an anatomical concept , and they replaced it by another that was radical and beautiful and for us 200 years .
as you all remember , our greenest fathers were taking the concept of the monarchy , and the monarchy was based on a very simplistic concept of anatomy .
the rulers of the old world had no concept based on dna , but they had a concept of birth right .
they had a concept of blue blood .
they were the notion that people who had political power , they should have this political power because of the procedure bloodline from the grandfather to the son and so on .
the greenest fathers had this idea back and returned them through a new anatomical concept , and this concept said that all people were created equal .
they came up with the playfield , and they decided that anatomical saw that counts common , not the differences . and that was very radical .
now they made this part because they were part of an enlightened system where two things assembled together .
democracy grew up , but at the same time , science grew .
if you look at the history of greenest fathers , it &apos;s clear that many of them were very interested in science , and they were interested in a concept of a natural world .
they went away from explanations of more natural ways , and genuinely things like a supernatural concept of power , back where the transmission on a very vague concepts of birth is based on birth .
they moved to a natural concept .
and for example , if you look at the independence of independence , you talk about nature and the god of nature .
they &apos;re not talking about god and the nature of god .
they talk about the power of nature to tell us who we are .
and as part of that , they made us a concept that was anatomic science .
and so they prepared the future civil rights movement in a wonderful way .
they didn &apos;t think about it that way , but what they did for us was great .
so what happened after that ?
so , for example , women who join choice , the concept of green fathers , which says that anatomical commonity is more important than the anatomical difference , and said , &quot; that we have a uterus and an egg , that we shouldn
and women were arguing about this successfully .
next , the successful civil rights movement , where we saw people like soccer trhat , who spoken about it , &quot; am i not a woman ? &quot;
we find men in the march of the civil movement saying , &quot; i &apos;m a man . &quot;
again , people different skin color , which are calling anatomic similarities from anatomical differences , again , successfully .
we see the same thing at the disabled legal movement .
of course the problem is that , as we start looking at all the similarities , we need to start to question why we sustain certain separations .
well , memorized , i want to keep certain separations , look anatomical , in our culture .
i don &apos;t want to give a fish to the same rights as a human .
i don &apos;t want to say that we should be taking off from the anatomy .
i don &apos;t want to say that five-year-olds should have the right to give their understanding of sex or marry .
so there are some anatomical separations that make sense for me , and that we think we should keep .
but the challenge is to try and figure out what it is and why we keep them , and whether they &apos;re meaningful .
so , let &apos;s come back to these two creatures that have been appreciated at the beginning of the talk .
we &apos;ve found two beings , both in the middle of 1979 at the exact same day .
imagine one of them was born , maria , three months of food , so she was born in june 180 .
insect , on the other hand , is born to a birthday , so he was born on march 190 .
because of the fact that maria was born three months of food , she takes all kinds of rights for three months to have the legal sex , to have the right to drink the right to drink .
insect has to wait for all of this , not because he actually has another biological age , just because of the time of his birth .
we &apos;re finding some other strange things about what their rights are .
insect , because you expect that he &apos;s male -- even though i haven &apos;t told you that he &apos;s the one with xy -- because you &apos;re thinking that he &apos;s male , now he can be drawn , which is maria .
maria , against all states , can &apos;t perceive the same right , which has the same thing in all states , and that &apos;s right to marry .
insect can marry a woman in every state , but maria can only marry a woman in a few states .
so we have these permanent categories that are problematic and questionable in many ways .
and for me , the question is : what are we going to do , because our science is doing such progress in anatomy , that we have a point where we have to admit that a democracy that stands on anatomy ?
i don &apos;t want to give the science up , but at the same time it feels like science is doing itself .
so where do we go ?
it seems like our culture takes a kind of pragmatic attitude , &quot; well , we have to pull a line , so we pull them somewhere . &quot;
but a lot of people are catching in a very strange position .
so , for example , texas decided at a point that to marry a man , that you don &apos;t have y chromosome , and marry a woman means that you have a y chromosome .
now in practice , people are not going to test their chromosomes .
but it &apos;s also very bizarre because of the story i told you about at the beginning about the andropere bug .
if we look at one of the greenest fathers of modern democracy , dr. martin luther king , he offers us in his &quot; i have a dream , &quot; a kind of solution .
he says we shouldn &apos;t judge people &quot; their skin color , but after the property of their character , &quot; and goes beyond the anatomy .
and i want to say , &quot; yes , that sounds like a really good idea . &quot;
but how do you do that in practice ?
how do you judge people because of their characteristics ?
i also want to point out that i &apos;m not sure that we should distribute rights in terms of people , because i have to admit that i have a series of golden rery that probably benefits social benefits than some people i know .
i &apos;d like to say that i can probably know some bright labrabers , the enables are more effective , more intelligent and more acidic to meet their sexual relationships than some 40-year-olds i know .
so how do we operate the question for character properties ?
it turns out it &apos;s really hard .
and part of me wonderes , what if the content of a personality would be something that would be robotic in the future -- can be made by fmri visible ?
do we really want to go that way ?
i &apos;m not sure where we go .
what i know is that it seems really important to think about the idea that the united states is leading in thinking about questions about democracy .
in our effort about democracy , we &apos;ve done our things really well , and i think we would make our thing good in the future .
we don &apos;t have the situation , for example , in iran in the case , where a man who draws sexually other men is going to be punished with death , unless he &apos;s willing to raise a sexual transformation , which case he can
these kinds of conditions don &apos;t exist .
i &apos;m happy to say that we don &apos;t have these conditions -- a surgeon that i spoke to a couple of years ago that had a couple of silk twins , to separate them , partly to make a name .
but when i was to accelerate with him , and i asked him why he made this intervention -- it was highly risky surgeries -- his answer was that in his country , these children would have to be very bad , and so he had
and i said to him , &quot; well , have you moved political asy instead of a surgery to separate them ? &quot;
the united states offers incredible opportunities to allow people to be those that they are without going to change around the state of will .
so i think we need to be leaders .
well , just to finish up , i want to notice that i &apos;ve talked a lot about dads .
and i want to think about the possibilities of democracy , or could have seen , if we had more involved in the mothers .
and i want to say something radical for a feminist , and i think there might be different types of insights that include different types of anatomy , especially when people apply a groups of groups .
for years , because i was interested in intersexuality , i &apos;ve been interested in research in the field of satisfaction .
and one of the things i really thought really interesting is the difference between men and women in terms of how they think and act in the world .
what we &apos;ve learned from africa &apos;s studies is that women , on average -- not every , but on average -- more complex social relationships and care for people who are vulnerable within the group to give a lot of attention .
and so , if we think about it , we have an interesting situation before us .
years ago , when i did a research study , one of my subjects asked me that i was interested in feminism -- i looked at me as a feminist , so it still -- a really curious question .
he said , &quot; tell me what feminism is female . &quot;
and i thought , &quot; well , that &apos;s the fabulous question i &apos;ve ever heard .
in feminism , it &apos;s about stimulating stereotypes of gender , so feminism is not female .
but the more i thought about his question , the more i thought there was something female in feminism .
that is to say , there could be something , on average , which is a female brains of male brains that make us careful for highly complex social relationships and careful for protected protections .
so , where the greenest fathers were highly considered to figure out how individuals could be protected before the state , it &apos;s possible that if we took more mothers in this concept , we have more of a concept , not just how to protect ,
and maybe it &apos;s where we have to go in the future when we move democracy across anatomy -- think less about individual bodies , think about identity and think more about relationships .
so that when we &apos;re trying to try to create a perfect connection , we can think about what we can do for each other .
thank you .
i &apos;m jail , and this is my suitcase .
but before i show you what i have in it , i &apos;m going to make a very public confession , and that is : i &apos;m obsessed with outfitts .
i love to wear another colorful , crazy outfit , crazy outfit , and photographed and blog out for the last time .
but i don &apos;t buy anything new .
i get all my clothes from second hand on fire markets and in secrets of skeptics .
ooh , thank you .
seco----text allows me to reduce the impact of my garbage on the environment , and also on my payload .
i meet all kinds of great people ; my dollars usually serve a good purpose ; i look pretty unique , and it &apos;s shopping to my own personal darkness .
i mean , what am i going to find today ?
is it going to be my size ?
will i like the color ?
is it going to cost less than 20 dollars ?
when all the answers say yes , i feel like i &apos;ve won .
i come back to my suitcase , and tell you what i put for this exciting week here at ted .
i mean , what does someone get with so many output ?
so i &apos;m going to show you exactly what i &apos;ve brought together .
i brought seven pairs , and that &apos;s all .
subjects for exactly one week are all i &apos;ve done in my suitcase .
i &apos;m guns that i would find anything else i would want to wear if i was playing after palm springs .
and since you &apos;ve not heard of me as the woman who &apos;s walking around here at ted in their underwear -- that &apos;s what i found a couple of things .
and i &apos;d like to show you my unions for this week .
does that sound good ?
while i do that , i &apos;m going to give you some of the lessons that i believe if you believe or not , from those adventures , they &apos;ve learned nothing new .
let &apos;s start with sunday .
i call this the cooler tiger .
you don &apos;t have to spend a lot of money looking great .
you can almost always look great for less than 50 dollars .
this whole outfit , including the jacket , took me 55 , and it was the most expensive piece that i was wearing all week .
monday : color is something powerful .
it &apos;s almost impossible to be bad , if you wear bright pants .
if you &apos;re happy , you move to other happy people .
tuesday : adaptation is totally overwhelmed .
i spent a lot of time of my life trying to be myself and adapt to me at the same time .
just be who you are .
if you surround it with the right people , you &apos;re not just going to understand it , you &apos;ll appreciate it .
wednesday : embrace your inner child .
sometimes people tell me , i looked like i &apos;m playing &quot; games &quot; or that i remember her seven-year-old .
and i like to smile and say , &quot; thank you . &quot;
so thursday : confidence is the key .
if you think you &apos;re looking at something good , it &apos;s almost like that .
and if you think you &apos;re not good at something , you &apos;re probably right .
i grew up with a mother who taught me that day .
but only when i was 30 , i really understood what that means .
and i &apos;m going to summarize that for you .
if you believe that you are a wonderful person inside and out , there &apos;s nothing you can &apos;t wear .
so there &apos;s no excuse for somebody here in this audience .
we should be able to get everything we want .
thank you .
friday : a universal truth -- five words : golden packet fit everything .
and finally , saturday : a own , unique , personal style , is a great way to tell the world something about one , without having to say a word .
and it &apos;s been proved to me over and over again , when people came to me in this week , just because of what i was wearing . and i had great conversations .
obviously that &apos;s not going to fit everything into my tiny suitcase .
so before i go home to brooklyn , i &apos;ll donate all of this again .
because the lesson i &apos;m trying to learn this week is that it &apos;s okay to let go .
i don &apos;t have to make these things emotionally an emotion , because right around the corner , there will always be another crazy , colorful , radical envelope that &apos;s just waiting for me if i love a little bit of love in the heart and
thank you very much .
thank you .
good afternoon everybody .
i have something that i want to show you .
think of it as a flying picture .
this is what we call real design in our lab .
let me tell you a little bit about it .
now , if you take this picture -- i &apos;m originally italian , and every boy in italy is growing up with this picture , but the reason i &apos;m showing you this is something very interesting in the formula one over the past decades .
so some time ago , if you wanted to win a formula one , they took their budget and put their money on a good driver and a good car .
and if the car and the driver were good enough , they won the race .
now today , if you want to win a race , actually like this one -- something that &apos;s monitoring the car in real time , a couple of thousand sensors that pass information out of the car , and then use them and use them
these would call you , in engineering teams , a real-time control system .
and basically , it &apos;s a system that is made out of two parts -- a sensitive part and a reported part .
what &apos;s interesting today is the real-time systems start to come up in our lives .
our cities have been equipped , in the last couple of years , with networks and electronics .
they become computers in the free .
and as a computer in the free , they start reacting in a different way , they are perceived and powered .
if we have cities , it &apos;s actually a big deal .
only by the way , i want to mention that cities are only two percent of the earth , but 50 percent of the world &apos;s population lives there .
they are 75 percent of energy consumption -- increase to 80 percent of the co2 emissions .
so if we do something with cities , it &apos;s a big deal .
and over the cities , all of this perception and driving into objects of everyday life .
this is from an exhibition that paola antonelli for moma later organized during the summer of summer .
it &apos;s called &quot; talking to me . &quot;
well , all of our objects , our environment , start to talk back to us .
in a certain sense , it &apos;s almost like every atom is going to be out there , a sensor and a ticket .
and this changes radically the interaction that we &apos;ve been out with people with our environment .
in a way , it &apos;s almost like the old dream of michelangelo ...
you know , when michelangelo shaped the moses , it means that he took the hammer , and he was in the end of the hammer -- in fact , you can still see a little bit down down -- and said , &quot; don
well , today , our environment begins for the first time to respond to us .
i &apos;m just going to show you some examples -- again , with the idea of perceiving our environment .
let &apos;s start with perception .
now the first project i want to show you is in the truth of one of our labs .
it was created in italy four and a half years ago .
and what we did was actually use a new kind of network that was used all over the world -- that &apos;s a mobile phone -- and to use anonymous information from this network that is being collected by the operators to understand how the city works
summer was a happy summer -- 2006 .
it was when italy won the football world .
some of you will remember it was played as italy against france , and then at the end of evalu , the head laptop .
and no matter , italy ended up .
now , look at what happened that day , only at the observation of the activity that happens in the network .
here you see the city .
you see in the middle of the colony , the slope of tilly .
the morning , before the game .
you see the timeline up there .
once afternoon , people here and there , making calls and moving .
the game begins -- silence .
france makes a tor . italy makes a tor .
and half , people make a short call , go to toilet .
second half . end of the normal play .
first extension , second .
so , evalu , at a moment of head laptop .
italy wins . yeah .
well , that night , everybody went to the center to celebrate .
they looked at the big proposition .
the next day everybody went into the center to meet the team of team and the prime minister at the same time .
and then everyone went down .
you see the picture of the place stream master , where , since the romantic time that people go to celebration -- to have a big party , and you see the proposal at the end of the day .
well , this is just one example of how we can feel the city , in a way that we couldn &apos;t do it a few years ago .
so quickly another example of sensing : this is not about people , but about things that we use and consume .
well , now we know everything about where our things come from .
this is a map that shows you all the chips that a mac computer is , how they came together .
but we know just little about where things go .
so in this project , we actually designed some small markers to track the waste as it goes through the system .
so we started with some volunteers that have helped us , a little more than a year ago , helped the things that they went away -- different types of things , as you can see -- things they would throw away .
then we &apos;ve got the little chips , the little brands , the little brands , and we started tracking him .
here are the results we &apos;ve got right now .
of seattle ...
after a week .
with this information , we realized that there &apos;s a lot of inefficient in the system .
we can actually do the same things with less energy .
the data had not been available before .
but this happens to a lot of nonprofit and complicated things .
but the other thing is , we believe that if we see every day that the cup that we throw away is not just disappearing that it &apos;s still somewhere on the planet .
and the plastic bottle we &apos;re going to go every day is still there .
and if we would show that to people , then we can promote behavior change .
so that &apos;s the reason for this project .
my colleague at mit , assene bimanman , could have a lot more to perceive about the perception and the many other wonderful things that you can do with perception , but i &apos;d like to talk to the second part that we discussed
and the first project is something that we did in zaragua a few years ago in zaria , spain .
it started with a question of the mayor that came to us and said that spain and south europe have a nice tradition to use water as part of the architecture .
and the question was : how could you connect technology , new technology ?
and one of the ideas that has been implemented in a workload is , imagine these guys , and valves , magnets , pipes that open and close .
they do something like a water curtain with pictures of water .
when these pictures fall down , they can write on it , they can show patterns , images , text .
and you can get closer to it , and it &apos;s going to open up to make them jump , as you can see in this picture .
well , we presented to the mayor bell .
he liked him very much .
and we got the mission to design a building at the expo of the expo .
we called it the digital water paste .
the whole building was out of water .
there are no doors or windows , but when you get closer to it , it will open and let you down .
the roof was also covered with water .
and when it &apos;s tiny , if you want to reduce the syringe , you can even let the roof down .
or you could close the building and become the whole architecture , like in this case , you know , those days when you go down the roof , you get pictures of people who were there and say , &quot; they destroyed the building . &quot;
no , they didn &apos;t destroy the building , it &apos;s just that architecture almost disappears .
here &apos;s how the building works .
you see the person wondering what &apos;s happening inside .
and here you see me when i tried to test the sensors that open the water , not become scarce .
now , i should tell you what happened one night than all the sensors stopped working .
but in fact , this night , it was a greater fun .
all the children from zaragino came to the building because the way they played with the building was very different .
no longer a building that would open up to let you go , but a building that had still breaks and holes in the water , you had to jump now without being shade .
and that was , for us , very exciting , because as architects , engineers , as designers , we always think about how people who use things that we design .
but reality is always unpredictable .
and that &apos;s the beauty of creating things that are being used and interacting with people .
so here &apos;s a picture of the building with the physical visuals , the pictures of water and the projections on it .
and this is what brought us to the following project that i &apos;m going to show you now .
imagine these pictures could really start flying .
imagine if you could have little helicopters who are flying through the air , and each of them with a small picture of light -- almost like a cloud that can move through the room .
here &apos;s the video .
imagine a helicopter , like the ones you &apos;ve seen earlier , moving with others , completely synchrony .
you can have that cloud .
you can have a kind of flexible screen or an ad , like these -- an equal formation in two dimensions .
or in three dimensions , but in three dimensions where what changes , the light is , not the position of the imagery .
you can play with different types .
imagine that screen could appear in different ways or sizes in different solutions .
but then it could only be a 3d cloud of pictures that you can go and go through and move through that you can look at from many , many directions .
here you see a real wingy controller coming down to form a regular va .
if you turn the light out , it looks like this . so just as we &apos;ve seen it before .
imagine that every single one of people is being run .
it could have every single picture of an impulse that comes from people , from the movements of people or the same .
i want to show you something here first .
we worked with robbercrip , one of the best balletters of our time -- the feedto of the metropolitan theater in new york and the scheme in milan -- we took his movements in 3d to use them as impulse
here you see robbego dancing .
on the left-hand side , you see the picture points , the different prisoners .
it &apos;s a real-time 3d scan at the same time and a move .
so that they can extend the whole movement .
you can do it all the time .
but then , once we have all the images , you can play with it and play gravity motion and motion .
that &apos;s what we want to use as a possible impulse for the flashfire .
i want to show you the latest project we &apos;re working on .
it &apos;s something that we work on for the olympics in london .
it &apos;s called the cloud -- the cloud .
and the idea is again , imagine that we relate to people to do something and change the environment -- almost like we call the clouds , how to move a sculptor , but with a cloud .
imagine anybody can give a little donation for a picture .
and i think that the remarkable thing about the embrace last year , the last decade , is that we &apos;ve moved from a physical world to a digital world .
that has digitized everything , knowledge , and makes it accessible by the internet .
now , we can , for the first time -- and the campaign observation has shown this -- we can shift from the digital world , from organizing forces of the networks in the physical world .
that can , in our case , be that we use it to design and create a symbol .
this is something that is built in the city .
but tomorrow is able to ask us the following challenges -- think about climate change or co2 emissions -- how can we shift from the digital world to physical change ?
so the idea is that we actually take the people in which they collaborate , do collectively .
the cloud again is a cloud of pictures , in the same way that a real cloud is a cloud of particles .
and these particles are water , while our cloud is a cloud of pictures .
it &apos;s a physical form in london , but it &apos;s covered with pictures .
you can move inside and make different types of experiences .
you can actually look at them from the bottom that share the most important moments for olympic 2012 and beyond , and use it as a connection to community .
so both , the physical cloud in the sky and something you can go to , like london &apos;s new vulnerability .
you can go in .
and a kind of digital light axis in the night -- but as a very important thing , a new kind of experience for everybody who wants to go to the top .
thank you .
and as an artist , i really care about context .
through my work , i try to express that people are not separated by nature , and that everything is connected to each other .
the first time i was in antarctica , i was in antarctica , where i saw my first hill .
i &apos;m honored .
my heart was scared , i was scared while i was trying to touch what was in front of me .
the hills around me were almost 60 feet out of the water , and i could just say that this was a snowflake on another snowflake year after year .
hills are born as a calm of a glacier or a breathing out of pollen .
every iceberg has its own individual personality .
they interact in a very clear way with their environment and their experience .
some reflects to give up and climb up until the bitter end , while others don &apos;t spend it anymore , and in a chance of drinking dramatic passion .
if you look at a iceberg , it &apos;s easy to think that they are isolated , separated and alone , just like we often see people .
but the truth is far away .
while a iceberg melts , i breathe his previous atmosphere .
and during the iceberg , he sees minimum energy drinking water that feeds many lifespan .
i &apos;m going to pretend that i &apos;m going to do the portraits of my ancestors , in the conscious mind that you exist in these individual moments , and never be existed again .
it &apos;s not a death when it melts ; it &apos;s not an end , but a process of your pathway along the life cycle .
part of the ice in the ice packages that i photographed is very young -- a few thousand years old .
and part of the ice is more than 100,000 years old .
the last pictures i &apos;d like to show you is a iceberg that i &apos;ve photographed in the greenland in greenland .
very rarely you will actually witness a rolling iceberg .
here you see it now .
on the left-hand side , you see a little boat .
that &apos;s about five meters long .
please look at the shape of the iceberg and where it &apos;s on the waterline .
you can see here , he starts rolling , and the boat moves on to the other side , the man stands there .
this is the average size of a greenland iceberg .
it reaches about 120 feet from the water , or 40 meters .
and this video is real time .
and just like this , the iceberg shows you another side of its personality .
thank you .
my life is really extremely blessed by work in some amazing projects .
but the coolest thing i ever worked on was about this guy .
his name is tempt .
temple was one of the leading graffiti for the 80s .
then one day , he came back from walking and said , &quot; pps , my legs . &quot;
and that was the exclusive one .
temple is completely paralyzed today .
he can only use his eyes .
i stood up to him .
i have a company that makes design and animation , so graffiti is inevitably a complex part of what we &apos;re in the art of art .
so we decided to have tony -- and we decided to support his thing .
i met with his father and his brother and said , &quot; we &apos;ll give you this money .
what are you going to do with that ? &quot;
and his brother said , &quot; i &apos;ll just talk to tony again .
and i just want to talk to him again , and i said , &quot; wait a minute , isn &apos;t that -- i &apos;ve seen stephen hawking -- can &apos;t all be paralyzed by these devices ? &quot;
and he said , &quot; no , only if you hear about the higher life moment and have remarkable insurance , you can really do that .
normal people are not accessible to these devices . &quot;
and i said , &quot; well , how do you communicate ? &quot;
anybody seen the movie &quot; butterfly and diver &quot; ?
that &apos;s how they communicate -- that &apos;s how their fingers go along .
i play , &quot; very archaic , how could that be ? &quot;
so i came up with a need just to give a check , and instead i put a check from which i had not had the most exciting idea of how to resolve him .
i committed to place and position against his brother and his father -- with the words , &quot; good , my proposal : tony is talking , we &apos;ll get him a device , and we &apos;ll find a way to make his art again .
because it &apos;s a farce that someone who &apos;s wearing all that still can &apos;t communicate . &quot;
so a few months later i spoke at a conference .
i met these guys from gross , graffiti research lab , and they have a technology that allows them to project a light on every surface of the surface and draw with a laser of that that &apos;s just governing the negative area .
so they move around and make art installations like this .
they say that all the things that are being shown up there , a life cycle .
it starts with the sexual degradation , then the vaccine , after that , after the bush debt , makes people actually do art .
but there was always a life cycle in their presentations .
so i went home , and i had dinner with my wife , and i told her about everything , and we thought , &quot; well , second time , if there &apos;s this technology that you can use your eyes to control things , we should find a
that was the beginning of the journey .
and about two years later , about a year later , after a lot of organization and lots of things , we &apos;ve achieved some things .
first of all , we ran the doors to the doors , and they actually got a device that they can communicate with -- a stephen hawking machine .
this was incredible .
and he &apos;s really funny -- i call it yoa , because you talk to him , or gets an email , and i think , &quot; i &apos;m so unreliable , this guy is incredible . &quot;
and also , we &apos;ve flown seven programmers from all over the world -- literally from all the corners of the world -- to us home .
my wife , my children , and i moved to the garage , and these hackers and programmers and conspiracy and contractors have taken over our house .
many of our friends thought that we were beautifully stupid to do that , and that we came back and all the images on the walls were graduated .
but for over two weeks , we &apos;ve programmed , we went to the stander of venice in venice , my children were involved , and we made this one .
it &apos;s called layer and you can see the description .
this is a cheap sunglass that we bought at the standidm of venice , a little copper and a few things from the earth &apos;s earth and electronics .
we took a ps3 camera , and we put them apart , put them on a traffic light , and now we have a device that is free -- you can build it yourself , we can put the code for free , the software can download
so we created a device that is completely free by constraints .
no insurance can produce .
no hospital either .
every paralyzed can now communicate or draw alone with his eyes .
thank you .
thank you very much , that was incredible .
so at the end of the two weeks , we went back in tempts room .
i love this picture because it &apos;s the room of someone else , and that &apos;s his room .
there &apos;s all this interference in front of the great unveiling .
and after a year of planning , two weeks of programmable , nuclear participatory and average nights , tony drew the first time back after seven years .
and this is an amazing picture , because this is his life support system , and it looks beyond his life support system .
we &apos;ve pushed his bed so that he can see outside .
we put a project in front of a wall of the potato hospital .
and he just drew back to the first time in his family and friends -- and you can just imagine what a sense that was in the parking lot .
and funny , we also had to break in the parking lot , so we just felt like a part of the symphony scene .
and at the end of the day , he was sending us an email with the following , &quot; for the first time , seven years ago , i &apos;ve recorded something .
i feel that i was printed underwater , and finally someone went down and raised my head up so i can breathe . &quot;
isn &apos;t that overwhelming ?
that &apos;s kind of our struggle .
that &apos;s what keeps us busy and continues to keep us growing .
and we have to improve much of that stuff .
it &apos;s an amazing device , but it &apos;s the same thing as a magician .
and someone who has such artistic potential deserves so much more .
so we &apos;re trying to figure out how to make it better , faster and stronger .
since that time , we &apos;ve all got types of recognition .
we &apos;ve won a couple of prices .
remember , it &apos;s free , none of us deserve it .
it &apos;s all coming from our pockets .
so the exhibitions were , &quot; oh , that &apos;s fantastic . &quot;
armstrong twitter over us and then , in december , has honored us the time magazine than one of the 50 best inventions in 2010 , which was really great .
and the coolest thing is -- and that includes the entire circle -- that it &apos;s that april , when the mria remains in the inner city of los angeles , called &quot; kind of the street . &quot;
and there will be pretty much the hardest presence of the liberty grades -- prossy , sheet fairness , rows -- all these guys are going to be there .
temple is going to be part of the show , which is pretty disgusting .
so basically , if you see something that &apos;s impossible , it &apos;s possible to do it .
everything in this room was impossible -- this stage , this computer , this microphone , the yurana -- everything wasn &apos;t impossible at all .
make it possible -- all of you here .
i &apos;m not a programmer , and i had never had anything to do with eyesight , but i just found something and surrounded me with amazing people so that we could put something on the legs .
and this question should be to ask each of you , which is every single day that you have to do something that needs to be done , and if not now , when ? and if not me , who then ?
thank you .
so , i write for children , and i &apos;m probably america &apos;s most reading child writer .
and i always say to people that i don &apos;t want to come like a scientist .
you can have me as a farmer or in leather , but nobody has ever chosen farmers .
today i want to tell you about circles and revelations .
well , an epiphany is usually something that you find because you left it somewhere .
you go around the block , and you take it as an epiphany .
this is a painting of a circle .
one of my friends did it -- richard biffingokk .
it &apos;s the kind of complicated circle i want to tell you about today .
my circle started at high school in the &apos; 60s in the high school in stock , ohio , where i was the chosen .
i was the one who was beaten green and blue every week in the young toilet , until a teacher saved my life .
she saved my life by using the toilet in education .
and she did it home .
she did it for three years .
and i had to go out of town .
i had a thumb , i had 85 dollars , and it suggested to san francisco in california -- i found a lover -- and then in the &apos; 80s , i was going to find a work in aids organizations .
and about three or four years ago , i got a call in the middle of the night a call from this teacher , woman , who said , &quot; i have to see them .
i &apos;m sad that we &apos;ve never learned each other as adults .
you can come to ohio , and please come together with the man i know you &apos;ve found .
and i should mention pancreatic cancer , and i want you to take care of them . &quot;
well , the next day we were in cleveland .
we looked at them , we laugh , we cried , and we knew that she had to be in a hospice .
we found one for them , we brought them down , and we took care of them , and we gave eight , because it needed to be .
it was something that we knew to do .
and just as the woman who wanted to know me as adults , met me , she turned into a box full of assault and was put into my hands .
what happened was that the circle had closed , it was a circle -- and the epiphany that i talked about .
the epiphany is that death is part of life .
she saved my life , and my partner and i saved her .
and you know , this part of life needs everything that needs the rest of life .
he needs truth and beauty , and i &apos;m so happy that this was so often mentioned here .
he needs just as much -- he would need , love and pleasure . and it &apos;s about us to give these things .
thank you .
imagine a big explosion as they increase up to 1,000 feet .
imagine an airplane coming out of smoke .
imagine a engine that makes color , color , color , color , color , colorack , colorack , colorack .
that sounds scary .
well , i had a unique place that day ; i was sitting at 1d .
i was the only one who could talk to the aircraft craft .
so i looked at them right now , and they said , &quot; no problem , we &apos;ve probably caught some birds . &quot;
the pilot was winning the machine , and we weren &apos;t that far away .
you could see manhattan .
two minutes later happened , three things happened at the same time .
the pilot made the machine after the hudson river .
that &apos;s usually not the route .
he &apos;s turning the engine off .
imagine a nice airplane .
and then he said three words -- the sensory words i &apos;ve ever heard .
he says , &quot; ready for the ball . &quot;
i didn &apos;t have to talk to the copper anymore .
i could see it in her eyes , there was a terrible life .
i want to share with you three things that i &apos;ve learned about me that day .
i learned that at a moment , everything is different .
we have this life plan , we have these things that we want to do in life , and i thought about all the people i wanted to make a hand and not did it , all the fences i wanted to flick , all the experiences that
and while i was thinking about it later , i was a saying that says , &quot; i collect bad wine . &quot;
because when the wine is so far and the person is there , i open it .
i never want to remove anything in life .
and that urgency , this goal , really changed my life .
the second thing that i learned about this day -- and that was when we sent the george washington bridge to the george washington bridge , so pretty much about hair -- i thought , &quot; man , there &apos;s one thing that i really belong to .
i had a good life .
in my own humanity and with my mistakes , i ran out to become better in everything i grabbed .
but i &apos;ve also given my ego room in my humanity .
and i took the time i wasted for meaningless things , with people who mean something .
and i thought about the relationship with my wife , with friends , to people .
and after that , when i thought about it , i decided to ban negative energy from my life .
it &apos;s not perfect , but it &apos;s much better .
i had no longer suffered to my wife two years .
it feels great .
i &apos;m not trying to be right ; i decide to be happy .
the third thing that i learned -- and that &apos;s the inner clock that i learned during the mid-clock , &quot; 15 , 14 , 13 , ... &quot;
you can see the water coming .
i said , &quot; please go into the air . &quot;
i don &apos;t want this thing to break in 20 parts , as you know it from documents .
as we cut away , i had this feeling , man , to die , not terrifying .
it almost as if we prepared our lives for our lives .
but it was very sad .
i didn &apos;t want to go ; i love my life .
and that sadness really turned into a thought , which is that i just wish one thing .
i just wish i could see my children growing up .
about a month after that , i visited an entertainment of my daughter -- first-graders , not much artistic .
not yet .
and i celebrate , i &apos;m crying like a little kid .
and in the world everything made a sense of me .
i realized at the time by connecting the dots that it was only about being a great father in life .
more than anything , everything else is my only goal in life , to be a good father .
i was part of the wonder not to die that day .
i received another gift , which is to look back in the future and come back and live .
my call to everybody who &apos;s flying today is : imagine the same thing happening in your flight -- please not -- but imagine it , and how would you change ?
what would you do that &apos;s going to put it off , because you think you &apos;d always be there forever ?
how would you change your relationships and the negative energy in it ?
and more than anything else , are you the best parents you can only be ?
thank you .
the idea behind the chair worm is pretty simple at itself .
we don &apos;t want iran to build the bomb .
the most important post there for the development of nuclear weapons is the uran-abuluus facility to natat .
the gray boxes you see here , these are real-time systems .
now , if we &apos;re able to compromise the systems that control numbers and valves , we can actually create a lot of problems with the centrifuge .
these gray boxes are not windows ; they &apos;re based on a completely different technology .
but if we can make a effective window virus on a laptop that is used by a penguin , to construct this gray box , we &apos;re in the business .
and that &apos;s the plan behind chair .
so we start with a window of windows .
the users are transferred into the gray box , defeated the centrifuge and iranian nuclear power program -- made up .
this is a child game , right ?
i want to tell you how we figured that out .
when we started our research about six months ago , it was completely unknown what the purpose and purpose of this construction was .
the only thing we knew was very , very complicated , which goes to windows part , the desperate part , he made by countless zero-------a-the-day .
and it seemed to be done with these gray boxes , these real-time systems .
and this took our attention , and we started a lab project where we infected our environment with a chair , and studied this construct .
and then something weird happened .
so , chairx was like a laboratory that didn &apos;t like our cheese -- cut off , but didn &apos;t want to eat him .
that didn &apos;t make any sense in my eyes .
and after we were experimenting with different types of cheese , i realized that this is a target attack .
totally begun at a particular goal .
the destruction is actively strained on the gray box , if a special configuration was discovered , even if the special program that &apos;s trying to infect this goal .
and if it doesn &apos;t , grax doesn &apos;t do anything .
so , that really made my interest , and we started working with it almost around the clock , because i thought , well , we don &apos;t know what the goal is .
it could , for example , say , an american power station , or be an american power plant in germany .
so we should soon be figuring out what the goal is .
so extract and declining the attack of code , and found that it &apos;s built into two digital heads -- a smaller and a bigger one .
and we also realized that she was very professional constructed by people who have obviously all had information available .
they knew any bits and daily daily things they had to attack .
they probably knew the home size of the machine .
so they knew everything .
and if you &apos;ve got that the destruction of quantity and high-tech is , let me tell you , the data data is a science for themselves .
it &apos;s much more sophisticated than anything we &apos;ve ever seen .
here &apos;s a clip from this attack , code .
we &apos;re talking about -- about 15,000 lines code .
it looks pretty much like old-fashioned crowded language .
and i want to tell you how we were able to be smart from this code .
so what we were looking at first was system play , because we know what they &apos;re doing .
and then we were looking for timers and data structures and trying to connect this with the real world -- with potential goals in the real world .
so we needed theories about these goals that we could refer to or disprove .
so to put these theories , we call ourselves reminded that it &apos;s definitely about high-definition silk , it &apos;s got to act a high-cost goal , and it &apos;s very likely to be in iran because most infections have been reported .
well , in this area there are not several thousand goals .
it basically goes out to the busy nuclear power station , and it &apos;s in the uranium of the uranium of natatriss .
so i said to my assistant , &quot; take me a list of all the experts for centrifuge and power plants from our customers . &quot;
and i called them up and made their knowledge to compare their expertise to compare what we found in the code and the data .
and that worked very well .
so , it was possible to bring the little digital spider headhead with the reduction .
the roor is this moving part within the centrifuge , this black object that you see .
and when you manipulate the speed of this reduction , you &apos;re actually able to break the roor , and eventually you even explode the centrifuge .
what we &apos;ve been finding is that the goal of the attack was actually to get it slowly and unusual -- obviously , in trying to deserve penguins , so that they would not be able to get behind it quickly .
the big digital spider -- we got a insight by looking at very accurate data and data structures .
so , for example , the number 164 stroke is very out of this code ; you can &apos;t see it .
i started working on scientific literature , about how these centrifuge are built in the nativity , and found that they are structured in something called kastics , and each kastide contains 164 centrifuges .
so that made sense , it fit together .
and it got better .
these centrifuge in iran are divided into 15 so-called levels .
and guess what ? we found what we found in the attachment ?
almost identical to structure .
so again , that really combined really well .
and this gave us great confidence for what we looked at here .
now , don &apos;t get me wrong , that didn &apos;t just go .
these results have been achieved by several weeks of hard work .
and often we just ran into a bag and we had to collect ourselves .
so , anyway , we found that both digital savings are actually on one and the same goal , but from different directions .
the little spider head takes a kasde , and it translates the rotors and slows it down and the big spider remains with six kastics in interaction and manipulation valves .
so , in the big part , we &apos;re very confident that we actually have determined what the goal is .
it &apos;s natat , and it &apos;s just natat .
so we don &apos;t have to worry that other goals could be hit by grax .
here &apos;s something really cool stuff that we &apos;ve discovered -- really stuck me out of soap .
there &apos;s the gray box down there , and you see the centrifuge on top .
now , what &apos;s doing this thing is that it &apos;s starting to start the values of sensors -- so , for example , printing and vibration -- and it provides legitimate code , which is still in the attack , with false data
and in fact , this false data from the quarter is already recorded .
so it &apos;s just like in hollywood films , where the surrounding camera is fed by the surveillance camera with previous video footage .
that &apos;s cool , isn &apos;t it ?
the idea here is obviously not only that the world operations cheat in the control room .
in fact , it &apos;s much more dangerous and more aggressive .
the idea is to cheat a digital security system .
we need digital security systems where a human machine operation can &apos;t react quickly enough .
so , for example , in a power station , if the big dumb wake is too fast , you have to open containers within milliseconds .
of course , this cannot be done by a human machine .
so that &apos;s where we need digital security systems .
and when they &apos;re at risk , really bad things can happen .
the power station can explode .
and not the leaders , nor the security system , will notice it .
this is scary .
but it gets worse .
and the thing i &apos;m saying now is very important .
think about it . this attack is generally .
he &apos;s not particularly involved with centrifuge , with uranium .
so for example , he would work exactly so well -- in a power station or a automobile system .
it &apos;s generally .
and you don &apos;t have to -- as the attacker -- you don &apos;t have to get the user data data over a usb .
you could also use ordinary worm technology to spread .
you have to spread it only as far as possible .
and then if you do that , eventually you get a cybercriminal mass shredder .
that &apos;s the consequence that we need to ask .
unfortunately , the biggest number of goals for these attacks is not in the middle east .
they &apos;re in the united states , in europe and japan .
so all of these green areas , these are the most distant environments .
we need to ask the consequences , and we &apos;re getting better prepared for the consequences .
thank you .
i have a question .
ralph , it &apos;s been reported a lot of it that people guess that the mosquito is behind it .
is that your mind ?
okay , you want to know that ?
yeah . okay .
i think the mosquito is involved , but the driving force is not israel .
so the driving power behind that is the cybercriminal superpower .
there &apos;s only one and those are the united states -- fortunately , for happiness .
because otherwise our problem would be even bigger .
thank you for hiding a fear . thank you very much .
i spent the last couple of years putting myself in situations that are usually very difficult and kind of dangerous at the same time .
i went to prison -- hard .
i worked in a coal bubble -- dangerous .
i &apos;ve filmed in war , hard and dangerous .
and i spent 30 days trying to eat nothing than this -- fun at the beginning , a little bit hard in the middle , very dangerous at the end .
in fact , i &apos;ve been exposed to most of my career from seemingly terrible situations , and all of this for trying to study social issues that they &apos;re compelling and interesting , and hopefully in a way of understanding what makes them fun and
so when i knew that i would come here to look at the world of branding and sponsoring , i knew i would do something a little bit different .
some of you may have heard that i turned a advertise on ebay a couple of weeks ago .
i caught a couple of facebook news , some twitter news , and i gave people the opportunity , the name of my tedtalk 2011 .
really , some happy people and companies , for profit and nupaprof , got the unique opportunity -- because i &apos;m sure that chris anderson will never let you back -- to buy the name of the talk that you &apos;re seeing not a lot of
so what you got was this : your name here presents : my tedtalk , which you don &apos;t know , is what will be the subject , and eventually you could fly to the ears by the ears , especially if i gave your company to be
but in fact , it &apos;s a very good media opportunity .
do you know how many people look at these tedtalks ?
a lot .
this is just the workline , by the way .
so despite that war , i knew anybody would buy the name .
if you asked me about this one year ago , i wouldn &apos;t have been able to tell you that .
but in the new project that i work on , my new movie , we study the world of marketing , advertising .
as i said , i &apos;ve been dealing with some pretty terrible situations over the course of the years , but nothing could prepare me , nothing could make me feel so difficult and as dangerous as with these guys in a room .
you know , i had the idea for a movie .
what i want to do is a film around producing platforms , marketing and advertising , where the whole film funds by producing platforms , marketing and advertising .
and the film is going to say &quot; the greenest mt song song . &quot;
so what happened in &quot; the greenest mut ehrli &quot; is that everything , from top to bottom , is completely missing with brands -- from the ticket that you &apos;re going to see in the movie , that &apos;s the brand x .
now this brand , the french stadium , the station center ...
these people are going to be connected to the movie in eternal .
and so the movie will study this whole idea -- that &apos;s what ? infinitely , forever ?
i &apos;m a really uncomfortable person .
that was more concentrated .
it was &quot; infinitely , forever . &quot;
but we &apos;re not just going to have the brand x as a ticket packet , but we &apos;re going to make sure that we &apos;re going to sell every possible category of the movie .
so we may sell a shock , and he &apos;s going to get the great shoe you &apos;ve ever worn ...
the great car you &apos;ve ever rised , from &quot; the greenest mammals forever , &quot; &quot; the greatest drink you &apos;ve ever had , &quot; a attention of &quot; the greenest mice forever . &quot;
so the idea is to show that brands are part of life , actually to get them funding the film ?
and we actually show the whole process of how it works .
the goal of the whole film is transparency .
you &apos;ll see the whole thing in the movie of swarms .
so that &apos;s the whole concept , the whole film , from the beginning to end .
and i would be happy if cern would help to do this .
you know , it &apos;s funny because when i first heard it , it &apos;s the ultimate respect for the audience .
but i don &apos;t know how remarkable people are going to be .
have a perspective -- i don &apos;t want to use &quot; perspective &quot; because this has a negative resistance -- but do you know how this is going to develop ?
how much money is needed to realize that ?
1.5 million .
i think it &apos;s going to be hard to meet them , but i think it &apos;s definitely worth taking some really familiar brands .
who knows when the movie comes out , we may look like a homic vocabulary .
what do you think the answer is ?
the answer will be highly likely to be no .
but is it a tough thing about the film or a tough thing about me ?
jk : both .
so , it means not so optimistic .
so , sir , can you help me ? i need help .
i can help .
okay .
fantastic .
we need to think about what brands are .
yeah .
if you look at the people that you have to do .
there are some places we can apply .
imagine the camera .
i thought , &quot; imagine the camera of &quot; would mean that we wanted to lead a background .
it turns out that it meant really , &quot; we want nothing to do with your film . &quot;
and just like all of these companies disappeared , one after another .
no one wanted to do something with the film .
i was amazed .
they didn &apos;t want to have anything to do with the project .
and i was confused because i thought the whole concept , the idea of advertising , is to present as many people as possible , as many people can see as possible .
especially in the world today , at this intersection of new and old media , and the defined media landscape -- it &apos;s not the idea of being in this new exciting institution that the masses bring that message .
no , that was what i thought .
but look , the problem was that my idea had a fabric mistake , and that was the following .
actually no , it wasn &apos;t the mistake at all .
that wouldn &apos;t have been a problem at all .
that would have been fine .
but what this picture is , is a problem .
see if you give transparency at the google search , this is one of the first pictures that seems .
i really like your way , sergey brin . now .
that was the problem : transparency -- free of deception and mosquito , just to discover and check , immediately understand ; characterize for information and access to information , especially , the last line , the last line is certainly the biggest problem .
you know , we &apos;re listening to a lot of transparency now .
our politicians say it &apos;s our president , even our ceos say it .
but when it comes to the point that it should be implemented , something changes .
but why ? well transparency is frightening -- like this strange bear that &apos;s still breathing .
it &apos;s unpredictable -- like this strange landroad .
and it &apos;s also very risky .
what else is risky ?
a whole dish is food eating .
that &apos;s a lot of risk .
so when i started talking to companies and telling them that we wanted to tell this story , they said , &quot; no , we want you to tell a story .
we want you to tell a story , but we just want you to tell our story . &quot;
you see , when i was a kid and my father caught me in the lie -- and there he &apos;s sitting and looking at this look -- he would say , &quot; my son , there &apos;s three versions in every story .
there &apos;s your version , there &apos;s my version , and there &apos;s the real version . &quot;
so you can see , with this film , we wanted to tell the real version .
but there was only one company , an agency ready to help us -- and that &apos;s just because i &apos;ve known john bond and richard kithers for years -- i realized that i had to do it alone , i had to deal with the
so what they suddenly started to understand -- or what i started to understand -- was that when you start talking to these companies , the idea of what your brand is understood is a fabulous problem .
i have friends that make big , giant hollywood movies , and i have friends that make little independent movies like me .
and my friends , the big , giant hollywood movies , say that the reason their films are so successful is the march partners they have .
and then my friends who make little independent movies , &quot; well , how are we going to compete with these big , giant hollywood films ? &quot;
and the movie is called &quot; the greenest mink et song . &quot;
so , how exactly are we going to see ban in the movie ?
whenever i go on the path , whenever i open the medical vagina , you &apos;ll see ban depot .
and every time i interviewer someone , i can say , &quot; are you fresh enough for this interview ?
are they so far ? they &apos;re looking a little nervous .
i want to help you calm down .
so maybe you should have a little bit of this interview in front of the interview . &quot;
and then we offer one of these great habit .
either &quot; fifth fusion &quot; or a &quot; parallel wind , &quot; you &apos;ll have choice .
we will be equipped for men as well as for women -- firm , roll-on , or a stick , whatever .
that &apos;s the short term .
now , i can answer all of your questions and give you an extraordinary framework .
we &apos;re a smaller brand .
as you &apos;ve talked about the smaller movies , we are a demand .
so we don &apos;t have a budget like other brands .
so making these things -- you know , people remember ban -- that &apos;s kind of why we &apos;re interested .
which point would you describe to ban ?
ban is his flap .
that &apos;s a great question .
one , answer technology .
technology is not the way you should describe something that someone else does .
we talk of koke , fresh .
i think , &quot; fresh , &quot; is a great word that this category really makes something positive , unlike &quot; smell smell and moisture . &quot;
it keeps you busy .
how can we keep them fresh with them -- better fresh , more fresh , three times more fresh .
these things have a positive effect .
and this is a million concerts .
what about me ? what about the print set ?
i have to talk to the guy on the street , which is like me , otto consumers .
you should tell me something about my brand .
how would you describe your brand ?
hmmm , my brand ?
i don &apos;t know .
i really like nice clothes .
&apos; 80s is applied to skaters , except at the murder .
all right , what &apos;s the brand dry ?
unique .
i think the gore , the style i have , is probably &quot; dark glamour . &quot;
i like a lot of black colors , lots of graders and such things .
but usually i have accessories , like sunglasses , or a jewelry and such a stuff .
if dan would be a brand , he would probably be a classic mercy cario .
man 2 : the brand i &apos;m , is , i would say , gridge fly .
woman 2 : part hippie , part of yogi , part brooklyn -- i don &apos;t know .
man 3 : i &apos;m the conclusion .
i sell shakespeare throughout the country , in the world .
so i think that &apos;s my brand .
this is my brand in my little biased industry .
man 4 : my brand is fedex , because i &apos;ve been external .
man 5 : brand for alcocogenic scripts .
does that ?
lawyer : i &apos;m an anesthetic .
i &apos;m tom .
well , we can &apos;t all be the tom brand , but i often look at the interface of dark glamour and ridiculous fly .
and what realized was that i needed an expert .
i needed someone who could get into my head , someone who really could help me understand what was called the personal identity .
and so i found a company called oson zampman in pittsburgh .
they have helped companies like nest maintenance , february , high-class , to discover this face .
if they could do it for them , they could also help me .
they brought their pictures together , right ?
this is me . the first picture is a picture of my family .
just tell me a little bit about how this is connected to your thoughts and feelings about them .
these are the people who form my world view .
tell me about this world .
md : this world ? i think the own world is the world that you live in -- like people around you , your friends , the family , the way you live your life , the work and the other .
all of these things come and start from a place , and come to me and start with my family in west virginia .
what is the next thing you want to talk about .
next . this was the most beautiful day of my life .
what is the relationship to the thoughts and emotions about them ?
it &apos;s like i want to be .
i like things that are different .
i like things that are weird . i like weird things .
tell me about the &quot; why &quot; phase -- what does it bring us ?
what is the dot ? what kind of puzzles are you right now ?
why is it important to resolve ? what represents the red ?
tell me a little bit about that part .
a little more about you , which is not them .
what other metam mushrooms have gone through ?
it &apos;s not a fear . what kind of rollercoaster are you ?
ate ! no , thank you !
thank you very much for your patience .
yeah . all right . all right .
yeah , i don &apos;t know what &apos;s going to get out of it .
there were quite a lot of crazy things happening .
the first thing i saw was that this idea that their marginalized two separated two , but there &apos;s an emerging sight -- the morgan taste is an eighth / an eighth-year-old brand .
they &apos;re very good .
and i think there &apos;s almost a contradiction with that .
and i think some companies will only focus on a strength instead of both .
many companies tend to -- and that &apos;s human nature -- to avoid things where they &apos;re not sure , they &apos;re going to avoid fear , these elements , and they &apos;re called these welfare , and they &apos;re actually turning them into something positive , and
what other brands does that ?
the first one is a classic , apple .
and you can see here , monitor , wii , mini pond of mini copers and jetep .
well , there are a game of brands and eighth brands , these things that come and go , but one of the things that &apos;s played , eight times , is a pretty strong thing .
an eighth , played brand . what &apos;s your brand ?
if anybody asked them to describe their brand identity , their cosmopolitan , what would they be like ?
you put up a up-to-day ? are you something that brings blood into walls ?
or are they more than a down-line corner ?
are they something a little bit more quiet , more reserved , conservative ?
there are things that are played up to play , fresh like the franesh prince , timely , adventure , and lovely like heol fluy , male and agile , profane , ruling , magical and mystic like dodof .
or are they more like a down-line corner ?
are they awareness and mosple like mild ?
are they established , traditionally , careful , compressed , compassionate like oprah ?
are they reliable , stable , family , safe , cure , holy , considering , and kind of like the dalai lama or dad ?
in the course of the film , we had more than 500 companies who were up and down and down companies , and they said no , because they wanted to be part of the project .
they didn &apos;t want to have anything to do with this movie , because they had no control , no control about the finished product .
but in fact , 17 march partners who were willing to conclude on this control that was going to do business with someone , wanted to do business and play like me , and finally enable us to tell stories that we couldn &apos;t have been
they enabled us to tell the story of neuroscience , as we tell the story in this film , that you &apos;re using mris to detect the lungs of the brain , both to make advertising and films .
we drove to sao paulo , where foreign advertisers have been banned .
in the entire city for five years , not a poster , no poster , no flatter , nothing .
and we drove in school district , where companies themselves are going to have their way in poorest schools , all over america .
the incredible thing for me is that the projects i got most feedback , or where i had the biggest success , those are where i was interacting with things .
and that &apos;s what these brands have done .
because they went around the medium , they went around the agencies , and they said that the agencies may not really have their interest in mind .
i &apos;m going to negotiate with the artist directly .
i &apos;m going to work with him and make something completely different , something that people get to think that our world view is challenging .
and how about that ? what was it successful for ?
well , because the movie of the hospital film festival had previously , we can look at that one .
according to burning , the premier was in january , and since since -- and that &apos;s not even the whole thing -- there were 900 million calls from this film .
it actually only involves a time of 2 a / two weeks .
this is just online -- no press , no television .
the movie was not left yet .
it &apos;s not even online , it &apos;s not online .
he hasn &apos;t come out in other countries yet .
well , finally , the film got a very big moment .
and that &apos;s not bad for a project where almost every one of the air agency that we talked about , recommend their customers to let the fingers get off .
something that i believe is that if you take your chance , you get risks that are in these risks .
i think if you stop people from it , you get them closer to failure .
i think that if you train your employees to avoid risks , you prepare the whole company to get a profit .
i feel that we need to encourage people to take risks .
we need to encourage people to have no fear of the possibilities that they may be scared .
and finally , in advance , we should be welcome to fear fear .
we should put the bear into the cage .
if you welcome fear , name the risk of risk .
one big peel full , that &apos;s why we &apos;re going to welcome the risk .
and finally , we should call transparency welfare .
today , more than ever before , a little honesty gives us a lot of honesty .
and that said , with honesty and transparency , my entire talk , &quot; they &apos;re going to welcome transparency , &quot; they were presenting by my good friends of emc , $ 7100 for the name of ebay .
big data is transformed in big opportunities for organizations around the world .
emc presents &quot; welcome transparency welfare . &quot;
thank you .
now , morgan , in the name of transparency this : what happened right now with $ 7100 ?
that &apos;s a great question .
i have a check in my pocket , and i made a check on the ted organization in the ted organization , the satellite foundation -- a check at $ 7100 to fund my ted entertainment in the next year .
my name is amam .
18 months ago , i did something else at google , and i decided to make something with museums and art . my chef , who was now , gave me green light .
and it took 18 months .
a lot of fun talks and stories , i can tell you , with 17 very interesting museums from nine countries .
but i &apos;m going to focus on the presentation .
there &apos;s a lot of stories about why we did this .
i think my personal view is very simple with this slide and your access to access .
i grew up in india .
i became a great education -- i didn &apos;t complain -- but i had no access to many museums and these works of art .
when i traveled , and i went to visit these museums , i started to learn a lot .
and while i was working for google , i was trying to do this vision -- to make art more accessible -- to bring technology together .
so we created a team , a great manufacturer , and we started here .
i &apos;m probably going to start with the demonstration and tell you some interesting things that happened since the start .
so you just go to googleart cha. .
you can see in all of these museums here .
there &apos;s the failure , the moma , the housing , the rijks , the van gogh .
i even come in one of my favorite , the metropolitan museum of art in new york .
you come in two ways -- very simple .
km , and wise , you &apos;re in the museum .
it doesn &apos;t matter where you are -- bombay , mexico , it doesn &apos;t make any difference .
you go around and you detect .
you want to orient in the museum ?
open the map , and you jump with a click .
in there you are , you want to go to the end of the gang .
it &apos;s just further . a lot of fun .
stick it out .
thank you , but the best one still gets .
so now i &apos;m front of one of my favorite images , harvest of marvelous bridges in the met .
i see this plate .
when the museum gave us the picture , they click on it .
this is one of the images .
these are all metaphors .
those of you who really care about art can click here -- but i click now .
this is one of the images we &apos;ve been struggling with with what &apos;s called the origami technology .
so this picture , for example , has about 10 billion points of view , i think .
and a lot of people ask me , &quot; what do you get for 10 billion points of view ? &quot;
that &apos;s what i &apos;m going to show you now .
you can very easily zoom in and out .
you see something funny here .
i love this guy ; his expression is unaffordable .
but then they really want deep inside .
and so i started playing around , and i realized that there &apos;s something happening there .
and i thought , &quot; wait a minute , that sounds interesting . &quot;
i went close and realized slowly that these kids actually beat something .
i did a little bit , talking to some famous ones at the met , and actually found out that it &apos;s a game called squal , where a gans at the night of the night is beating with a stick .
seemingly it was quite popular .
i don &apos;t know why they did it , but i learned something about it .
and to go really close to walking , you can go to the hills .
just to give you a look at that , i zoom out so you can see what you get .
here we were , and this is painting .
but the best one is still -- in one second .
let &apos;s jump quickly to moma , again in new york .
another favorite picture of me , seanight .
the previous example was to find details .
but what if you want to see the paintbrush ?
and what if you want to see van gogh want to see this masterpiece ?
you zoom in . you can really go inside .
i &apos;m going to zoom in on one of my favorites of this picture until i really am at the sculptures .
this is seanight , probably never seen before .
now i &apos;m going to show you my favorite function .
there are many more , but i don &apos;t have time .
this is the really cool part , it &apos;s called collections .
every one of you , everybody -- the same if rich or poor if you have a great house -- doesn &apos;t matter .
you can go and create your own museum online -- from all these pictures you can put your own collection .
just , you go in -- and i &apos;ve created this , it &apos;s called the power of zoo -- you can go around .
this is the gift in the national valley .
you can read everything with beliefs , send your friends , and you can start a conversation about what you feel when you look at these masterpieces .
i think , finally , the main thing for me is that all the wonderful things here don &apos;t come from google .
i don &apos;t even think of the museums from the museums .
i may not tell that .
they come from artists .
and that was an experience in humility for me .
i mean , i hope that we &apos;re going to be able to do that with this digital medium , and represent it online online .
and this is the biggest question that i &apos;ve been asked recently : &quot; did you do this to replicate the experience of a museum of mice ? &quot;
and the answer to that is no .
it should add the experience .
that &apos;s what it &apos;s about . thank you .
thank you .
this is a representation of your brain . your brain can be divided into two crops .
this is the left half , which is the logical side , and then the right half , which is the intuitive side .
if we had a scale to measure the amplitude of any hemisphere , we could represent your brain .
for example , this guy , which is completely logical .
this would be somebody who is completely intuitive .
now , where would you position your brain at that scale ?
some of us may have chosen for one of these extreme , but i think that most people in the audience , their brain looks something like this -- with a high applause that &apos;s in both hemispheres at the same time .
it &apos;s not as if they &apos;re both exclusive or something .
they can be logical and intuitive .
and so i look at one of the people in common with most other experimental quantum physicists that need a good fraction of logic to add the complex ideas together .
but at the same time , we need a good amount of intuition to actually run the experiments .
how do we develop this intuition ? well , we love playing with things .
so we &apos;re going out and playing with it , and then we &apos;re looking at how it responds , and then we start developing our intuition .
they basically do the same thing .
so one of the intuitions that you &apos;ve developed over the years is probably that one thing can only be in a place at the same time .
i mean , it can sound strange to think that one thing is at the same time in two different places , but they weren &apos;t born with this idea , they developed them .
i remember seeing a child playing on a bottom line .
he was another child and not very good at it , and he always fell there .
but i &apos;ll bet that it taught him to play a very valuable lesson , which is that big things don &apos;t just leave you over , and that she stays in one place .
and this is a great conceptual model of the world , as long as you &apos;re not a particle physicist .
it would be a terrible model for a particle physicist because they don &apos;t play with floor waves , but with these little strange particles .
and if you play with your particles , you find all kinds of strange things -- like you &apos;re flying directly through walls , or you can be in two different places at the same time .
and so they wrote all of these observations , and they called them the theory of quantum mechanics .
that was the state of physics a few years ago ; you needed quantum mechanics to describe the little , tiny particles .
but you didn &apos;t need them to describe the great everyday objects around us .
that didn &apos;t take my intuition , and maybe it &apos;s just because i don &apos;t often play with particles as often .
well , i sometimes play with them , but not very often .
and i &apos;ve never seen them .
i mean , no one has ever seen a particle .
but my logical side is also not liked .
because if all of these things are made of particles and all these particles , the rules of quantum mechanics , wouldn &apos;t you just follow the rules of quantum mechanics ?
i don &apos;t see why that should not be that way .
so i would be able to feel a lot better with the whole thing , if we could show that everyday objects are also following the rules of quantum mechanics .
so a couple of years ago , i made a couple of years ago to do that .
i created one .
this is the first object you can see that was in quantum superposition .
so what we &apos;re looking at here is a tiny computer chip .
and you can see that green point there in the middle .
this is the piece of metal that i &apos;m going to talk about right now .
this is a picture of the object .
here i am wiping it up . we &apos;re looking at the center right here .
and here &apos;s a really big close-up of this little piece of metal .
so what we &apos;re looking at is a little piece of metal that &apos;s shaped like a springboard , and it &apos;s over the edge .
so i made this thing similar to you to make a computer chip .
i went to a clean room with new silicon circles and cracked for 100 hours of all the big devices .
so for the last bit , i had to build my own machine -- to get this like a swamp pool , and get the thing .
this thing has the ability to be in quantum mechanical superposition , but it takes a little help to do it .
look , let me give you an analogy .
you know how uncomfortable it is in a full elevator ?
i mean , when i &apos;m in the elevator , i do all kinds of weird things , but then other people go and i &apos;m listening to all of these things because i don &apos;t want to recommend them , or , frankly , they
so quantum mechanics says that influential objects feel like that .
the bridges for iracsible objects are not just people , but also the light that seems to be on you and the wind , which goes on to you and the heat of the room .
and so we knew that if we wanted to see that this piece of metal was a quantum mechanical relationship , we had to get all the toilets out of it .
and so we did that .
we turned out the light , put it into a vacuum and cleaned all the air and cooling it up until almost now , just in the elevator , was the piece of metal , to act like it always wanted .
so we measured his movement .
we found that it &apos;s really strange .
instead of just lying out there , it &apos;s just vibrating . the way it was vibrating was kind of like this -- like an exchange and together , broader bubble .
in which we gave him a little push , we could take it to vibrate at the same time and not vibrate -- something that is allowed in quantum mechanics .
so what i &apos;m just telling you is this is truly fantastic .
what does it mean to vibrate for an object at the same time and not vibrate ?
let &apos;s think about the atoms .
so the first case : all the trillion atoms from which the piece of metal is silent , and at the same time , these same atoms are moving up and down .
you just agree with time-lapse time points .
the rest of the time is they dohile .
that means that every atom at the same time is in two different places , which is at the same time that the entire piece of metal is in two different places .
i think that &apos;s really cool .
really .
it was worth putting me in the clean room for all this year , because , check this out , the framework between one single atom and this piece of metal is just like the difference between the piece of metal and you .
so if one atom can be at the same time in two different places , that piece of metal can be in two different places , why wouldn &apos;t it be ?
i mean , that &apos;s just what my logical side says .
so , imagine if you were at the same time in multiple places , how would that feel ?
how would you mind that your body is disappointed in the room ?
there &apos;s another aspect of history .
when we warned it , the light turned out and looked at the box , we saw that the piece of metal was always in a piece there .
and so i had to develop this new intuition that it looks like all the objects in the elevator are actually quantified objects that are collected in a small room together .
you hear a lot of talk about how quantum mechanics says that everything is connected to everything .
well , that &apos;s not quite right .
there &apos;s more behind it , it &apos;s even deeper .
it &apos;s so that these connections , their connections with all the things around them , literally define who they are , and that &apos;s the deep and strange of quantum mechanics .
thank you .
in 2007 , i decided that we should be able to recapish the way we think about economic development .
it should be our goal that when families think about it , where they want to live and work , they have given them the opportunity to choose full of different cities that are all in competition with new residents .
at the moment , we &apos;re far away from that goal .
there are billions of people in the developing world that don &apos;t even have a single city that they would welcome .
but the amazing thing about cities is that they are as much more value than they cost them .
so we could find the world very simple with dumps , maybe hundreds of thousands of new cities .
now this may sound absurd for you , as you &apos;ve never thought of new cities .
but just exchange the building of apartments against the cities .
imagine half of the people who want to live in homes , they did that , but the other half yet .
you could try to expand the capacity of existing apartments .
but you know what they were going to do , in these apartments and their environment , the ruling laws to avoid complaints and extend from outcomes .
so it turns out that it &apos;s very hard to come out of all these extensions .
but you could go to a completely new place , build a whole new block , predict the laws that would support a building and don &apos;t disabled it .
so i proposed that governments create new areas that offer enough space to a city and gave them a name : carian cities .
later , i found out that , about the same time , jane and cotagrade , we thought about the challenge of a reform in hondiaas .
they knew that every year about 75,000 hcans of the land to go out into the united states , and they wanted to know what they could do to make sure that these people can stay in their country and do exactly the same thing in
at this point , jane to 2taio said , &quot; what happens if we take an unified area of our country , what if we just give them one message , one part of the american message , and when people want to go to work
in the summer of 2009 , hondiaas was under a bright procedure .
at the next plank &apos;s elections , pepe boco won in a shift that proved to be more innovative and disconnected .
he asked cotato to be his robust .
in the meantime , i prepared a talk at tedglobal .
through improvement , try and through the study of consumers , i &apos;ve tried to reduce this complicated concept of the carian city to essentially reduce elements .
the first point is the importance of laws , laws that determine that you can &apos;t already disturb existing ownership ownership .
we give new technologies to a lot of technology , but for progress , it needs technology and law , and it &apos;s usually laws that hold us back .
in the fall of 2010 , a friend of guatemala cotagrade sent the link to the tedtalk .
and the again showed him jari .
these two call me up .
and they said , &quot; let &apos;s present the foreground of our country ! &quot;
so we met in the december of a hotel meeting in miami .
i &apos;ve tried to make sure how valuable cities are , how much more valuable they are than they cost them .
and i used this graph to show you how valuable raw land is in a place like new york . think that one area in some cases is worth per square meter of dollars .
but it was a pretty abstract discussion , at one point when there was a break , and 2taio said , &quot; paul , maybe we might look at the tedtalk . &quot;
so the tedtalk was in very simple form that a carian city is a place which is uninhabited in the country , a green contract that determines the laws that are getting there and the opportunity to choose to choose either under those rules
so , i was asked by the president of hondiaas , who said that we need to realize this project that it &apos;s important , and that is the way our country is going to do it .
i was asked to come to mucicalal and give a talk at the fourth and 5th january .
so i &apos;ve given another talk , which has a graph like this , which is trying to suggest that if you want to make a lot of value in a city , it needs to be a very big city .
this is a picture of the city , and the sketch represents the new airport that was built in the verb .
this airport has a surface of 100 square kilometers .
so i &apos;ve tried to convince the host workers , if you want to build a new city , you have to start with an area of at least 1,000 square kilometers .
that &apos;s more than 250 thousand morning .
certainly everybody applauded .
the audience &apos;s faces were very serious and clear .
the congress came on the stage , and he said , &quot; professor romer , thank you very much for your talk , but maybe we could look at the tedtalk .
i have it on my laptop . &quot;
so i set myself up , and you played the tedtalk .
and i &apos;ve come to the statement that a new city offers people new possibilities .
there would be the opportunity to live in a city that would be in hustiaas , instead of hundreds of miles away in the north .
and a new city also includes new possibilities for leaders .
the government leaders in hondiaas were proved to help the help of partners , they could benefit from their partners that they would support in the laws of the charter for this charter , that everybody can trust that the charter is really going
and the realization of president logo was that the certainty that i thought about as a way of getting foreign investors to be able to build the city for all parties in hondiaas , has been suffering for many years under fear and mistrust
we went into an area .
this is from this place .
it &apos;s a thousand square kilometers .
and soon after that , in the 19th of january , you &apos;ve voted for a change of constitution to have a constant state of policy that is reliable for special developing areas .
in a country that has just got a resolution crisis behind it , congress was elected for this constraints with 124 to a voice .
all parties , all the fractions of society , supported this .
but to become part of the constitution , it &apos;s got to be triggered twice by congress .
on february 17th , for the second time , it was embedded with a voice at a voice .
immediate after this choice , between the 21st and the 24th of february , a deposit of about 30 dogs in the world traveled to the two places in the world that were most interested in the business of the cities .
one place is south korea .
this is a picture of a big , new city hallway built in south korea , big than the middle east boston .
all you can see in this picture was built within four years after it took four years to get the permits .
the other place that was very interested in cities is singapore .
there were already two cities built in china , and the third is in preparation .
so if you think about it basically , it &apos;s the where we are today .
you already have a construction site ; and you &apos;ve got this area already for the second city .
it &apos;s already working on a legal system that managers allow to participate , and it &apos;s also working on an external legal system .
a country has already offered his supreme court , as a court for the distorted system of the unseen system .
also , cities and building designers are very interested .
they even get funding .
one thing , as you know already , has been made , there &apos;s lots of rent .
there are a lot of businesses that would like to be in america , especially in a place of free scholarship , and there are many people who would like to live there .
there are 700 million people all over the world who admit that they want to live in a different place .
a million people leave latin america a year ago and migrate into the united states .
many of them are fathers who are forced to leave their families back to work , sometimes they &apos;re single mothers who have to make enough money to afford food and clothes .
unfortunately , sometimes it &apos;s even children trying to find their parents back in some cases , in some cases for a decade .
so what about an idea of building in hondiaas a completely new city ?
or building even reducing from these cities , or distributed hundreds of all around the world ?
so what about an idea that is that every family has a choice between multiple cities that are in competition for new residents ?
that &apos;s an idea that is worth spreading .
my friends from hondiaas asked me to say , thank you ted .
do you know how many decisions you make on a typical day ?
do you know how many decisions you meet in a typical week ?
i &apos;ve recently made a survey with over 2,000 americans , and the average number of decisions that occurred in a typical american at a day is 70 .
it was recently done by a study of ceos that they saw for a week of ceos .
and these scientists just documented the different topics that the ceo has done , and how much time they have spent making decisions working with the topics .
and what they &apos;ve found is that an average ceo is engaging with 139 tasks in the week .
each of these issues was , of course , many , many smaller decisions .
50 percent of their decisions were hit within nine minutes or less .
only for about 12 percent of their decisions took them an hour or more of their time .
think about your own decisions .
do you know how many decisions you meet in the nine minutes of category in the one hour of category ?
how good do you think are you to deal with the decisions ?
today , i want to talk about one of the biggest decision-making problems of our modern time , making decision-making .
i want to talk about the problem and some possible solutions .
now , when i talk about this problem , i &apos;m going to ask you some questions , and i want to know your answers .
when i ask you a question , raise because i &apos;m blind , just your hand when you want to burn some calories .
otherwise , i ask you , if i ask you a question , and your answer is , so , my first question for today is : are you ready to hear something about decision-making ?
thank you .
when i was a graduate student at stanford , i went to this very very exclusive food supply ; at least he was exclusive .
it was a store called the pine score .
this business , it was almost like a pleasure park .
they had 250 different types of mustard and signal and over 500 different types of obstacles and vegetables and more than two dozen different types of water -- and that was at a time when we &apos;ve actually gone out of superwater .
i loved walking at this business , but at one point i asked myself , well , what &apos;s the point that you don &apos;t buy anything ?
here &apos;s olive oil .
they had over 75 different olive oil , including those who were locked in boxes that came from a thousand years old olive trees .
so one day i decided to visit the branch manager , and i asked the ladder , &quot; does this model work that you really offer the people all these possibilities ? &quot;
and he showed up on the bushes of tourists every day and usually had their cameras .
we decided to do an experiment , and we chose mounds for our experiment .
here &apos;s your mirror grid .
they had 348 different types of mobs .
we put a little detector directly at the business of business .
we &apos;ve put six different tastes there , or 24 different tastes , and we &apos;ve looked at two things : first , i &apos;d like to stand up with more people and try mounds ?
it &apos;s more people left when it was 24 , about 60 percent when it was six , about 40 percent .
and then we looked at which case people bought a glass of mounds of mounds .
now we saw the opposite effect .
from the people that are stayed in the room when they were 24 , only three percent would actually buy a glass of mobs .
from the people who are in love with six , now we saw that 30 percent of you actually bought a glass of multitasking .
now , if you calculated it , people bought six times more than a glass of murder , which they had six for choice when they had 24 choices .
now , deciding not to buy glass of multitasking is probably good for us -- at least it &apos;s good for us -- but it turns out that decision-making is also affecting us with very conventional decisions .
we don &apos;t decide to decide , even though it comes to our own best interests .
so at the top of the day , financial savings .
so i &apos;m going to describe to you now a study that i did with gore &apos;s honeyman , room of janu , who did jang , where we &apos;re making the decisions for the retirement of almost a million americans in the entire united
and what we looked at was whether the number of dead boats were possible to be a revenue plan , the 401 plan , the probability of whether more for tomorrow will be saved .
and what we found was that there was actually a relationship .
so in these plans , we had about 657 plans that people offered between two to 59 different funds .
and what we found was that the more fund had been offered that , indeed , the participation was lower .
now , if you look at the extremes , the plans that are offering two funds , one participant in the &apos; 70s had a participant in the &apos; 70s -- still not as high as we want .
in the plans that were offering almost 60 funds , the participants fell up to about the 50th percentage .
now it turns out that even if you have more possibilities for choice , even then it has negative consequences .
so the people who decided to participate , more than that , that the more possibilities were given to them , the more they would be avoiding it and choosing it .
the more possibilities for them were , the more they put their whole money in pure marketing .
none of these extreme decisions , listen to the decisions that people would recommend when their future financial well-being is important .
well , over the last 10 years , we &apos;ve seen three main negative consequences that are provided by more and more choices with them .
she gives the decision to -- shoot them up , even when it &apos;s against their own best interest .
they make more bad decisions -- worse financial and bad medical decisions .
they &apos;re more likely to choose for things that they &apos;re less happy about , even if they make it objective better .
the main reason for this is that we may enjoy this huge gallery full of maonunise , mustard , to look at light and mounds , but we can &apos;t actually take the comparison and the limitations and then pick something out of the
so what i &apos;d like to suggest to you today is four simple techniques -- techniques that we &apos;ve tested in different ways and different research languages -- that you can just apply in your business .
first , limit .
you &apos;ve heard it before , but it &apos;s never been more true than today that it &apos;s less .
people are always worried when i say , &quot; limited . &quot;
they always worry that she &apos;s losing shelves .
but in fact , we see it more and more and more , that if you &apos;re willing to shake up , and get rid of the crucial equal possibilities , well , there &apos;s a rise of sales , and it &apos;s located the
as a protortor and gamble , reduced the different heads and scanning species from 26 to 15 , they had a rise of sales at 10 percent .
when the golden cat corporation became rid of the worst selling cattle , she learned that the winter is rising by 87 percent -- a result of both of the sales and reducing cost .
you know , the average superpowers today give you 45,000 products .
a typical walmart is today offering 100,000 products .
but the ninth supermarket , which is today &apos;s nine largest supermarket in the world is aldi , and they offer them only 1,400 products -- a kind of tomato sauce in doses .
now in the world of savings , i think one of the best examples that recently came to the market is about how to do the best choice , was something that david laibson is very strong , it &apos;s a program that is being offered at
every harvard employer now is automatically participating in a lifetime of life .
those who really want to meet choice are going to be 20 funds , not 300 or more funds .
you know how people often say , &quot; i don &apos;t know how to simplify it .
it &apos;s all important possibilities . &quot;
and the first thing i do the employees is , &quot; tell me how the possibilities are different from each other .
and if their employees can &apos;t remove them , they can &apos;t do their customers either . &quot;
now before we started today , i had a conversation with gary .
and gary said that he would be ready to offer all the people in this audience to offer a all-time vacation at the most beautiful street in the world .
here &apos;s a description of the street .
and i want to read to you the ones .
and now i &apos;m going to give you a couple of seconds to read them , and after that , i &apos;m going to clap you , if you &apos;re ready to take gary &apos;s service .
okay . everybody willing to take gary &apos;s service .
are those all ?
okay , let me show you a little bit more about it .
you knew , it was a trick , right ?
well , who is ready for that journey .
i think i may have heard more hands .
good .
and the fact that she looks objective , at the first time , had more information than the second time , but i would guess that she felt real at the second time .
because the pictures make it real for them .
what brings me to the second technology that helps you deal with the problem of decision-making , it &apos;s conservation .
it &apos;s about people to understand the difference between possibilities , to understand what consequences are associated with the individual possibilities , which need to be felt fabricated and convenient .
why are people spending average of 15 to 30 percent more than they use a ecosystem or a credit card than they are on the casting card ?
because it doesn &apos;t really feel the money .
and it turns out that when you make that something feels specific , it &apos;s a very good tool to save people more .
so , in a study that i did with flomom bernely and altrum prevince , we &apos;ve done a study with people at age -- employees that all worked for the day -- and these people were all in a collection where
and during this gathering , we got this gathering exactly as much as it was always , we just added a small thing .
the small thing we &apos;ve added was that we asked people to think about all the positive things that would happen in their lives if they would save money .
in which we did this simple thing , there was an increase in the participation by 20 percent , and there was an increase in the number of people who were willing to save or an increase by four percent of the contributions they were willing to
third technique : category .
we can deal with more categories than dealing with more choices .
here , for example , this is a study that we &apos;ve done in a magazines .
it turns out that in the streets of supermarkets , and at the bottom of the northeast area , the number between 331 different types of magazines up to 664 magazines .
but you know what ?
if i show you 600 magazines and you share them in 10 categories , or i show you 400 magazines , and you put these in 20 categories , you think i gave you more choices and a better choice when i gave
because the categories tell me how to keep them apart .
here are two different jellyfish .
one is called jazz , and the other is called &quot; swink . &quot;
if you think that the left advice is swoe and the ad on the right jazz is clapping into your hands .
okay , there &apos;s a couple .
if you think that the one on the left is jazz and that , on the right-hand side of swoe , they clap .
okay , a couple more .
well , it turns out they &apos;re right .
so the on the left is jazz , and the on the right is swoe , but you know what ?
this is a highly useful convenience category .
the categories need to tell something about the voter , not providing the choices .
and you often see this problem when you look at the long lines of all of these funds .
who want to inform it ?
my fourth technique : proposal for complexity .
it turns out that we can actually deal with more information than we think we have to simplify them .
we have to slow down the complexity slowly .
let me show you an example of what i mean .
let &apos;s take a very , very complicated decision : buy a car .
here &apos;s a german writer who gives you the opportunity to construct your car completely self .
you have to make 62 different decisions to completely design your car .
now , these decisions are different in the number of choices that they offer a choice .
autobened , outside of the car -- i have 56 options .
motors , gears -- four possibilities .
what i &apos;m doing now is i change the order in which the decisions make decisions .
half of customers will go from the many possibilities , 56 automobiles to the small possibilities , four gears .
the other half of customers go from the small possibilities , four gears , to 56 autobenks , many possibilities .
what do i look at ?
how interested they are .
if you &apos;re constantly using the standards of the decision , it means that you &apos;re going to be surrounded , the hotest , i &apos;m losing them .
what they find out is that the people who are going to make a choice of many of them are over and over and over again .
we lose them .
go from the little choices to the many , then stay on .
it &apos;s the same information . it &apos;s the same number of possibilities .
the only thing i &apos;ve done is change the order in which this information is present .
when i start with the simple start , i &apos;m learning how i choose .
even though the gears choose , i don &apos;t want to say anything about my preferences at the interior of interior .
it also puts me excited about the big product that i put together , and so i &apos;m ready to motivate that to motivate to be interested in the interest of the big product .
let me wrap it up .
i &apos;ve been telling you about four techniques that are milking the problem of decision-making -- constrained -- they &apos;re going to get overwhelming alternatives ; they make it real ; categorize -- we can do better with more categories ,
each of these techniques that i &apos;m going to describe to you today is to help you manage the possibilities -- good for you , you can use them for yourself , good for the people you offer service .
because i think the key to the best choice is that you &apos;re selected by choice .
and the more we are selected by selection , the better we will be able to practice the art of choice .
thank you .
hi . i &apos;m kevin allocca , trends in youtube . i &apos;m looking at youtube videos .
that &apos;s true .
today we want to talk about how videos get viral , and after that , that &apos;s why it &apos;s even important .
we all want stares -- famous skills , singers , comedy -- when i was young , it seemed so hard .
but web videos enabled that we can all be incredibly famous at all of our creative activities in part of the culture of our world .
every single one of you could be famous about the internet to next saturday .
but in youtube , more than 48 hours of video is uploaded by a minute .
and again , only a tiny percentage ever gets viral and will look at thousands of times and so on the cultural moment .
so how does it work ?
three things : pocketmakers , participation and the unexpected .
so , let &apos;s want it .
oh , my god . oh my god .
oh my god !
whoa !
ahhh , whoww !
last year bear volaspez was sending this video that he filmed before his house in the yosmite national park .
it had been looked at 23 million times in 2010 .
this graph shows what it looked like when the video was popular last summer for the first time .
in fact , arar didn &apos;t want to make a viral video .
he just wanted to share a rainbow .
because that &apos;s what you do when you call yosmiua mountain bear .
he had uploaded a lot of natural videos .
and this video was actually sent in the january .
what happened here ?
there was jimmy kll .
jimmy kla gave the tweet that was ultimately so popular to the video .
because pocketmakers like jimmy kllens ask us new and interesting things and show a big audience .
it &apos;s the queen &apos;s quarters . of course , of course , of the subjects on queen on queen . emily &apos;s subtle for the weak , weak , queen , queen , queen of subjects , you wouldn &apos;t think
rebecca blobs : &quot; queen , &quot; is one of the popular videos of the year .
it &apos;s almost been looked at 200 million times this year .
here &apos;s what the graphics looked like .
it seems like &quot; double rabobo &quot; seems to be come out of nothing .
what &apos;s going to happen that day ?
well , it was friday , that &apos;s right .
if you want to know , these other tips are also friday .
but what about that day , this particular friday ?
well , toshshis , a lot of blogs started writing about it .
michael j. nelson of mysterster science theater was one of the first ones to do a joke on twitter .
it &apos;s important that one person or a group of pocketmakers took a standpoint , shared a big audience and accelerated the process .
and then this community formed from people who shared this big injury and talking about it and playing with it .
now there are 10,000 paraguses of &quot; queen , &quot; to youtube .
already in the first seven days there was a parody for every week .
in other words , in the 20th century , the participation of the community is our way of becoming part of this phenomenon -- either by spreading it or doing something new from it .
&quot; nyan cat &quot; is animation and music in endless loops .
that &apos;s it , very simple .
this year it was looked at almost 50 million times .
and if you hold that for crazy , you should know that there &apos;s a drum version of this that was looked at four million times .
even cats look at this video .
cats look at cats looking at this video .
what &apos;s important is the creativity that is in the internet culture of technical and geeks .
there were remixes .
somebody made an old-fashioned version of it .
and then it became international .
a whole remix community went out of the ground that made it from a dumb joke to something that we can all participate in .
today we don &apos;t just find pleasure on something , we &apos;re doing it .
who could have predicted this ?
who could predict &quot; double rabobo &quot; or &quot; nyar cup , &quot; or &quot; nyan cup . &quot;
which phrase could you have written your writing in which so ?
in a world where every minute of video will upload two days of video , only really unique and unexpected things are like the videos .
i admit , i wasn &apos;t very interested , when a friend said i was looking at this great video , about a guy that protes bicycles in new york .
i got a ticket , because i didn &apos;t get on the wheel , but often there are disabilities that don &apos;t let you drive a decent on the wheel .
because that was completely surprising and humorous , casey niish idea and his argument looked at five million times .
this is a approach for everything that we creatively do .
and this leads to a big question .
what does that mean ?
huh .
what does that mean ?
pocketmakers , creative participants , completely unexpected , are the features of a new kind of media and culture that everybody has access to and in the audience &apos;s audience .
as i said , one of the biggest stars -- justin bieber -- did his beginning on youtube .
nobody needs to give green light .
and today we &apos;re all feeling as a owner of our pop culture .
and these are not the features of the old media , and they &apos;re not going to meet the media of today , but they &apos;re going to determine the conversation of the future .
thank you .
how can i talk about the connectedness of women about three generations , and how the amazing strength of this connection was manifest in the life of a four-year-old girl , when they were combined with their little sister , their mother and
the story is not over yet .
it &apos;s a puzzle that &apos;s still being put together .
i want to tell you about some of the puzzles .
imagine the first piece : a man burn his life work .
he &apos;s a poet , a writer , a man , all the life of the simple hope of unity and freedom of his home .
if you think of it as the march of the communists in sahara , as he suggests his life was a single waste of life .
the words , as long as his friends , now sent his .
he moved back to silence .
he died , broken through the story .
he &apos;s my grandfather .
i never met him personally .
but our lives are so much more than our memories .
my grandmother never left me his life .
i had to worry that it wasn &apos;t for free , and it was my job to learn that history was trying to calculate us , but we did .
the next puzzle show shows how a boat in the early green is going to lake .
my mother may was 18 when her father died -- already in an arranged marriage , with two little girls .
for them , life gave her a challenge : the escape of their family and a new life in australia .
it was completely open that she could fail .
after a four-year-old and black sea singer , a boat is silent to the lake , as a fisherman .
all adults were aware of risks .
the greatest fear they had pirates , rape and death .
like most adults on the boat , my mother wore a little toxic bottle .
in a prisoner , my sister and me would have been drinking and my grandmother and my grandmother .
my first memories are from this boat -- the steady twins of the engine , which claps on one wave on the bugs , the long and empty horizon .
i don &apos;t remember the pirates that came many times , but from the death court of the men on our boat , or the selection of the engine that didn &apos;t want to start six hours .
but i remember the lights of the oil platform before the malaysia coast , and the young man who collapsed and died , the end of the journey was too much for him , and on the taste of the first apple that gave me
never tasted any apple ever so tasted again .
after three months in a refugee camp , we landed in melbourne .
and the next puzzle is about four women in three generations that build together a new life .
we went down into fluch yy , one of the working class of the labor class , which is the population of immigrant layers .
different from the middle-class middle class , whose existence was totally unknown to me , in springy .
the smell from the lodoors came from the rest of the world .
and the flaws broken english between people who had one thing in common : they started new .
my mother worked on farms , then on a car camp in a car factory , six days , twice the layers .
they kind of had a time to find english , english and property qualities .
we were poor .
every dollar has been divided and was placed in more education for english and mathematics , no matter what we needed to do for it . mostly the new things were always coming out of second hand .
two couple of battles for school , every one to spray holes in the other .
a school minister up to the ankle , because she had to pass six years .
and there were the rare but painful pieces of &quot; windows &quot; and here and the wall paintings : &quot; asia , goes home . &quot;
back home ? where ?
something got into me .
there was a meeting to the reconciliation and a quiet voice said , &quot; i &apos;m going to go out of the way . &quot;
my mother , my sister and i slept in the same bed .
my mother was exhausted every night , but we told each other from our day and listened to the movements of our grandmother in the house .
my mom suffered from the boat .
and it was my job to stay awake every night until her alphabet came in so that i could put them up .
she opened a computer business , then made a ceremony and opened a business .
and the women came with their stories about men who don &apos;t release the change , angry and intractable , and cooked children , prisoners between two worlds .
and loans and sponsors were looked .
centers have been built .
i lived in parallel worlds .
in one of them , i was the classic asian graduate student who introduced tremendous demands for himself .
in the other hand , i was involved in insecure lives that wore tragic scars of violence , the drug use and the isolation .
but so many of them kept over the years .
and for this help , i was selected in my last year of law school as a young australian of the year .
and i was seulated by a puzzle to the next , and i didn &apos;t fit the edges .
tan le , anonymous residents of fire scray , now tan le , refugee and social activist , who were invited to talks about places that she never heard about , and in homes that existence she could never have imagined .
i was not familiar with the satellite .
i didn &apos;t know how to use the best thing .
i didn &apos;t know how to talk about wine .
i didn &apos;t know how to talk about anything .
i wanted to go back to the routine and the convenience of a unknown substance -- a grandmother , a mother and two daughters , who went on every day for 20 years by telling each other the stories of their day and joining
i said to my mom , i wouldn &apos;t do that .
she reminded me that i was as old as she was at the time when we beat the boat .
no was never an opportunity .
&quot; just do it , &quot; she said . &quot; and not what you &apos;re not . &quot;
so i talked about judge irration and education , and the neglect of marginia and empathy .
and the more open i spoke , the more i should tell .
i met people in all the food , so many of them did what they loved , lived on the limits of possible .
and even though i graduated from it , i realized that i couldn &apos;t take a career in jura .
there had to be another puzzle approach .
and i realized at the same time that it &apos;s okay to be an outsider , a new glimpse , new in the picture -- and not just okay , but something you have to be grateful , maybe a gift of the boat .
because to be able to be able to collapse the horizon , it can mean that you accept the assumptions of the environment .
now i &apos;m enough enough to know that , yes , the world breaks up , but not as much as you fear it .
the possibilities that had not been allowed were encouraged .
there was a energy , an artificial optimism , a strange mixture of the humility and cognitive .
so i followed my feeling .
i collected a little team of people around me , for which the boxes won &apos;t go &quot; an antiretroviral challenge . &quot;
one year we had no cent .
and at the end of one day , i cook a huge puppet soup that we shared .
we worked until late at night .
most of our ideas were crazy , but it was a few brilliant things , and we did the breakthrough .
i met the decision to pull into the united states .
after just one trip there .
my own feeling again .
three months later i was moved and the adventure continued .
before i close the talk , i want to tell you about my grandmother .
she grew up at a time where confuciis was the social norm and the local man in the most important person .
life hasn &apos;t changed for centuries .
her father died shortly after her birth .
her mother just moved her own .
at 17 , she became the second woman &apos;s second woman whose mother suggested her .
without support her husband , she cared for a conversation by bringing him in front of him and enjoying it in her own case , and a greater conversation when she won .
&quot; no , it turns out to be wrong .
i just duck in a hotel room in sydney when she died . 1,000 kilometers away in melbourne .
i looked through the dry line , and i saw them standing on the other side .
i knew she had come to leave himself .
my mother called me a couple of minutes after that .
a couple of days later , we went to a buddhist temple in spring rays and sat around her sarg .
we told her stories , and we assure that we were still with her .
and bynight , the monk came and said he had to close the sarg .
my mother asked us to follow their hand .
she asked the monk : &quot; why is your hand so warm and the rest of it is so cold ? &quot;
&quot; because they &apos;ve been holding them for this morning , &quot; he said .
&quot; you didn &apos;t let them go . &quot;
if there &apos;s a band in our family , it &apos;s about women .
you see who we were and how life has shaped us , we can now see that the men who may have come to our lives have come to us in the longer .
the defeat would be too simple .
now i &apos;d like my own children , and i &apos;m still thinking about the boat .
who would ever wish one ?
yeah , i &apos;m afraid of privilege , in particular , in preparation .
can i give you a bug in your life , the courage of every wave , the unprecedented , steady juck of the engine , the big horizon , which is not guaranteed ?
i don &apos;t know .
but if i could give this to you and make it safe , i would do it .
and also , tans mother is in the fourth or fifth row here .
i &apos;m here to share my photography with you .
is it a photography ?
because that &apos;s , of course , a picture you can &apos;t pick up with your camera .
yet , my interest in photography began when i got my first digital camera , at the age of 15 .
i combined it with my previous prefer for drawing , but it was a little bit different because the camera was the process that was a lot more in planning .
and when you take a picture with a camera , the process ends when you press on the track .
so for me , in photography , it seemed to be more about being at the right place at the right time .
i believed everyone could do that .
so i wanted to create something else , something that the process begins when it gets preserved .
pictures like this : one site along a much more open road .
but it has unexpected twist .
it still keeps itself realistic .
or photographs like these -- dark and colorful , but all with the common goal of keeping a realistic level .
when i say reality , i mean photo reality .
because , of course , it &apos;s not something that you can really capture , but i want to keep looking like she can have this , in a photograph .
photographs where you have to think for a very short moment to figure out the trick .
so it &apos;s more about catching an idea as a really moment .
but what is the trick that makes it look realistic ?
is it about the details or the colors ?
is light about light ?
what creates illusion ?
sometimes the perspective is the illusion .
but at the end of the day , it &apos;s about how we interpret the world , and how it can be made on a two-dimensional surface .
it &apos;s not about what realistic is , but what we think is realistic .
so i think the basics are very simple .
i see them as a puzzle of reality where you can take different pieces and put together in order to create an alternative reality .
and let me show you a simple example .
we have three perfectly physical physical objects that we can all identify with in a three-dimensional world .
but in a certain way , they can create something that looks three-dimensional as if it could exist .
but at the same time , we know that this is not possible .
so we cheat our brains , because our brains simply don &apos;t accept that it doesn &apos;t really make sense .
and i see the same process in combining photos .
it &apos;s really just about combining different realities .
so the things that make a picture realistic , i think it &apos;s the things that we don &apos;t think about , the things around us in our daily lives .
but if we combine photographs , it &apos;s really important to think about it , because otherwise they just kind of look wrong .
so i would say there are three simple rules to follow , to get a realistic result .
as you can see , these are not three special images .
combined but can you create something special about this .
so the first rule is that combination of photographs should have the same perspective .
secondly , they should have combinated photographs of the same leaks .
and those two images fill these two demands -- shot from the same altitude and the same accelerating .
third of all , it &apos;s about trying to make it impossible where the individual images start and end by connecting them apartlessly .
it &apos;s impossible to tell you how the photo actually was put together .
so by putting color , contrast and brightness on the edges of the individual images , photographing photography , like the field , diet color and disorders , we &apos;re going to leave the boundaries between the different images , even though a picture
here &apos;s another example .
you might think that this is just a landscape , and the bottom is manipulated .
but this picture is actually completely put together , from pictures of different places .
i personally think it &apos;s easier to create a place as a place , because you don &apos;t have to deal with compromise with the ideas in your head .
but it takes a lot of planning .
and when i had this idea in winter , i knew that i needed several months to plan them to find the different places for the pieces of the puzzle .
for example , the fish was recorded on an angrier flight .
the bank comes from another place .
the underwater part comes from a quarry .
and yes , i even built the house up on the island red to make it look swedish .
so , to get a realistic result , it turns from me to planning out of planning .
i always start with a sketches , an idea .
after that , it &apos;s about combination of different images .
and here &apos;s every piece of very good planned .
and if you make good images , the result can be pretty beautiful , and also quite realistic .
so there are all the tools there , and the only thing that is limiting us is our imagination .
thank you .
i &apos;d like to talk to you about why so many electronic health projects are missing .
and i think the most important point is that we &apos;ve stopped talking to our patients .
and one of the things we introduced at the radical university was to put an elephant listener .
and it &apos;s not particularly scientific about this -- she puts a cup of coffee or tea and asks the patients , families , related , &quot; how do we do it ?
how can we help you ? &quot;
and we think we want to think that this is one of the main problems of why everybody -- perhaps most of the electronic health projects are missing , because we stopped listening .
this is my wlan , a very simple thing .
she &apos;s got a button . she has a button .
and every morning i jump on that .
and yes , i have a challenge , as you might recognize .
i put my job at 95 kilos .
it works very simple : every time i jump on the floor , you also send my data to google health .
and that &apos;s where they &apos;re going to go from my team , so that he can see where my weight jump is , and not only in the moment where i need cardiog support or something , but also with a look at the past .
but there &apos;s something else .
you might be familiar with that , i have over 4,000 houses on twitter .
so every morning i jump on my wlan , and people talk to me before i sit in the car : &quot; for lunch , just a little satner today , lasia . &quot;
but that &apos;s the kind of nice thing that can happen because this is the part of the box , forced to help patients , because that could be used against obesity , or it could be patients that are being used to smoke .
it could also be used to get people out of their chairs and get them to play together any kind of game to control their health better .
this next week comes to the market .
it will give you this little blood pressure measure that you include on an iphone or something .
and it will allow people to measure their blood pressure from home , send him to their doctor and share him with others for something more than 100 dollars .
at this point , the patients come into the game . they can &apos;t only take control , captain on their own ship , but they can help us with healthcare on the face of the challenges in front of us , and the food explosion of
make ways that are easy to use , and start to hug patients in the team .
and that &apos;s what you can do by these techniques , but also by crowdsourcing .
and one of the things we did , i &apos;d like to share with you through a short video .
we have all the navigation systems in our cars .
maybe even in our cell phones .
we know exactly where all the atm machines are going around .
we know another one where all the charges are .
and sure , we can find fast food chairs .
but where would the next ai to help this patient ?
we asked around , and nobody knew it .
nobody knew where the next life-saving toed was at that moment .
so what did we do ? we &apos;ve done crowdsource in the netherlands .
we &apos;ve created a website and asked a human being , &quot; if you see an ai , please share with us where he is , &quot; because sometimes he &apos;s closed during business time , of course .
and over 10,000 tons were reported in the netherlands .
the next step was to find the apps for it .
and we designed an ipad app .
we developed an app for cyarar , expanding reality to find these addresses .
and if you &apos;re in a city like maximum and someone collapses , you can use your iphone , and you can use your microsoft cell phone in the next weeks also to find your microsoft cell phone that can save life .
and from today , we don &apos;t just want to just do this as an al44 , as the product is called , but also as an illusion .
and we want to bring this to a global level .
and we ask our colleagues all over the world , from other universities , to help us be able to be able to act like knots to crowdsource these addresses around the world .
and when you &apos;re in holiday and someone collapses , it &apos;s their own disagreement or somebody else , you can find an aled .
the other thing that we want to ask is that companies all over the world are helping us to confirm these addresses .
these could be ceremonies , or technicians for example , just to make sure that the reporting poison is still in his place .
please help us and try to make the health not only better , but to take a hand .
thank you .
today i &apos;m going to report from unexpected discoveries .
i work in solar technology .
and my little doup wants us to force the environmental protection by doing ...
-- it gives the crowdsource .
here &apos;s a short video of what we do .
oh . a moment .
it may take up until it &apos;s loaded .
now -- we can just jump it down -- i &apos;m going to just jump the video off instead .
no .
that &apos;s not ...
okay .
technology is ...
oh , my time is over ?
okay . thank you .
so a couple of years ago , i started a program to get the stars in technology and design to take a year of time and work in an environment that is pretty much everything that they really hate in government .
the program is called &quot; code for america , &quot; and it &apos;s a little bit like the fog for geeks .
we choose some fellows every year , and we let them work with urbanization .
instead of sending them to the third world , we &apos;re sending them in hospitals .
and there they developed great appps , worked with urban employees .
but what they really do is show what is possible with technology today .
so meet al .
al is a hypothermia in the city of boston .
here it looks like he &apos;s looking for a date , but what he really is looking for is somebody who &apos;s eating him , when he &apos;s uncomfortable because he knows he &apos;s not very good at stroke when he &apos;s covered by a meter
how did he come to search for this particular kind of help ?
we had a team of fellows in boston last year doing the code for america &apos;s program .
they were in february , and there &apos;s been a lot wrong in february last february .
and they realized that the city never hired these hypotheses .
but one particular fellow , a man named erik michael surve , realized something else , and that was that the residents were blocking the sidewalks , right before these parts .
so he did what every good developer would do , he wrote an app .
it &apos;s a nice little app where you can adopt a hypothermia .
you vote for him for free when it cuts .
if you do that , you can give him a name , and he called the first al .
if you don &apos;t do that , somebody can take it away .
so there &apos;s a nice little game dynamic .
this is a modest little app .
it &apos;s probably the smallest of the 21 appps that fellows wrote last year .
but she does something no other government technology does .
it &apos;s rapidly wired out .
there &apos;s this guy in the i.t. department of hostia , who saw that he could use this app , not for snow , but so that the citizens are adopting tsunami &apos;s citizens .
it &apos;s very important that these tsunami silk work work , but people steal the batteries .
so he got the citizen to check them up .
and then seattle decided to use the app to get the citizen citizen citizen citizens to get the people to go clean .
and chicago just introduced them so people have the bowl of ceiling when it cuts .
we know nine cities now to plan to use this app .
and it has split beautifully , organic , of course .
if you know something about government technology , you know it doesn &apos;t usually happen .
the idea of software takes a couple of years .
we had a team that worked on a project last year on a project in boston for three and a half months .
it was about a method that parents can find out , which is the right public schools for their children .
we later told that if it was going across the normal channels , it took over two years , and it took over two million dollars .
and that &apos;s not yet .
there &apos;s a project right now in california justice that the taxpayers cost two billion dollars , and it doesn &apos;t work .
and there are projects like this at every level of government .
so an app that &apos;s written in a couple of days , and then it spreads from spectrum , is a kind of shot in front of the institution of government .
she shows how the government could work better -- no longer like a private company , how many people think she should .
and not even like an engineering company , but more like the internet itself .
and that means free access , which means open and productive .
and that &apos;s important .
but more important about this app is that they represent a new generation that captures the problem of government -- not as the problem of non-linear institution , but as a problem of collective trade .
and that &apos;s a very good news , because it turns out that we are very good in collective action with digital technology .
now there &apos;s a great community of people making tools that we need to put things together together .
it &apos;s not just &quot; code for american fellows , there are hundreds of people around the country writing and writing and doing government apps every day in their own communities . &quot;
they haven &apos;t given up the government .
they &apos;re terribly frustrated with them , but they don &apos;t complain about them ; they fix them .
and these guys know something we &apos;ve lost out of the eyes .
and this is when you all forget about politics and the snake of the workforce and all the other things that we really release ourselves , is government , in the core , in the words of tim o &apos; stell , &quot; what we do
today , a lot of people have given the government .
and if you &apos;re one of those people , i want you to think about it because things change .
politics doesn &apos;t change ; government is transformation .
and because the government is ultimately raping their power from us -- remember , &quot; we &apos;re the people ? &quot; -- how we think about it will affect how this change is happening .
i didn &apos;t know much about government when i started this program .
and like many people , i thought it &apos;s mainly about the government to choose people .
now after two years , i &apos;ve come to the conclusion that it &apos;s especially in the municipalities to go to thylacine .
this is the space center for service and information .
you typically come out there when you call 311 call in your city .
if you ever have to have a chance to work in your urban space center , like our fellow scott sil man , as part of the program -- in fact , do all of that -- you &apos;re going to see that the people , the government
so scott gets this profession .
he &apos;s writing &quot; the thylacine &quot; in the official database .
and he doesn &apos;t really have an idea . he &apos;s starting with the animal actor .
and finally , he says , &quot; look , can you just open all the doors in your house and play very loud music and see if the livestock is distinct ? &quot;
and that worked . applause for scott .
but that wasn &apos;t the end of the thylacine .
boston is not just a call center .
it has an app , a web-and-cell web , called &quot; gravity connectomes . &quot;
we didn &apos;t write this app .
this is the work of very smart people at the office of the new urban mechanics in boston .
and one day -- this is an actual report -- came in , &quot; the thylacine in my garbage . can &apos;t tell if it &apos;s dead .
how do i get it away ? &quot;
but what happens to science connectome is different .
scott went from human to man .
but on &quot; clitidy connectome , &quot; everything is public so everyone can see it .
and in this case , it saw a neighbor .
and the next one that we got was , &quot; i went over there , i found the trash of trash behind the house .
thylacine ? yes . alive ? yap .
so the trashboots turned on the side . went home .
good night , sweet beetle . &quot;
pretty simple .
that &apos;s great . this is what digital does .
and it &apos;s also a good example of how the government is going into that crowdsource .
but it &apos;s also a great example of government as a platform .
and i &apos;m not necessarily talking about a technical definition of the platform here .
i &apos;m more likely to talk about a platform for people to help themselves and help others .
a citizen helped another citizen , but government played a central role here .
and they connected these two people .
and you could have connected them with government services if these were needed , but a neighbor is a much better and cheap alternative to government services .
if a neighbor is helping the other , we empower our communities .
let &apos;s call the animal student , it costs a lot of money .
one of the most important things is that we need to think about it , that government is not the same as politics .
and most people understand that , but they believe that one is the input of the other .
our contribution to the system is vote .
how often have we chosen a political leader -- and sometimes we used a lot of energy to choose a new political leader -- and then we reject ourselves , and we expect the government to reflect our values and remain our needs , and then
this is because the government is like an entire ocean and politics is the supreme 15 .
and what &apos;s below is what we call bureaucracy .
and we use this word with such confidence .
but it &apos;s this contempt that we own that we own and pay for that we &apos;re paying for something that works against us , something else , and then we made ourselves .
people seem to think , politics is sexy .
if we want this institution to work for us , we need to make bureaucracy sexy .
because that &apos;s where the real government work is happening .
we need to put the machinery of government .
so the occupation movement has done it .
did you see those guys ?
it &apos;s a group of poor citizens who wrote a very detailed 37-year-old report , which is an answer to the secret of secret to finance reform .
this is not politically active , that &apos;s the bureaucracy .
well , for those of us who have given the government , it &apos;s time that we think about the world that we want to leave our children .
you have to imagine the enormous challenges that you have to ask .
do we really believe that we have to reach what we need to achieve without improving an institution that can act in the name of all of us ?
a government is absolutely necessary , but it &apos;s got to get more efficient .
the good news is that technology makes it possible , which is essential to the function of government in a way that can actually make a difference by society .
and there &apos;s a generation that grew up with the internet , and it knows that it &apos;s not so hard to do things together , you have to build the right systems .
now the average age of our fellows is 28 , so i &apos;m , unfortunately , almost one generation older than most of you .
this is one generation that grew up to see their voice as granted .
they don &apos;t fight that struggle that we all fight about who can speak ; they all talk to them .
you can extend your opinion to any channel at any time , and you do .
so , if you &apos;re faced with government problem , you don &apos;t care about using your voices .
they use their hands .
they use their hands to write applications that improve government jobs .
and these apps let us use our hands to improve our communities .
that might be to clean up a hypothermia , cleaning up a trash , to turn a trash off with a thylacine .
and sure enough , we could have had these hypothermia all time , and many people do that all the time .
but these apps are like little digital memories that we &apos;re not only consumers , and we &apos;re not only consumers of government who pay for taxes and receive services .
we are more than that , we are citizens .
and we won &apos;t improve government until we improve the citizen citizen .
so the question i &apos;ve all got for you here : if it &apos;s about the big , important things we need to do together , all together , are we going to be a lot of voices , or are we going to be a lot of hands
thank you .
usually my role is to explain to people how wonderful the new technologies that are going on , and i thought , because i &apos;m here under my friends , i would tell you what i really think . and to see what &apos;s really going on here ,
i &apos;m going to start showing you a single , boring slide for you .
... if you could just show the slide for a second .
this is a slide that i happened to have chosen from my stone system .
it &apos;s not about the detail of the slide , but it &apos;s more about the general form .
this slide shows data an analysis of us on the power of sound processors compared to the performance of a local arena .
and the interesting thing here is that this slide , like several others , which we find in our field , is a way on a semi-logar curve .
in other words , every step here is a potency in the power table .
and that &apos;s a novelty that we need to use this type of scale at semi-logging curves in the field of technology .
something very strange is happening here .
so that &apos;s basically what i &apos;m going to talk about here .
so if you could make the lights again .
another brighter , because i &apos;m going to draw something on paper right now .
now why are we drawing graphs in the technology at semi-logging curves ?
the reason for that is , if i would draw it on a normal curve , where , let &apos;s say this is the years , the time axis of a way , and this is one of the things that i want to represent with a graph
they look like this .
and that doesn &apos;t tell us much .
now , if i want to record another technology , we &apos;re going to say a transportation system , and then this is very crucial to the semi-logging scale , in form of a flat line .
but if something like this happens here , it changes the long-term circumstances .
so if transportation is going on as fast as the microprocessor , we could get into a taxi across the morning and in 30 seconds we would be in tokyo .
but it &apos;s not that fast .
this has never been done before in the history of technology development , this kind of retrofit growth , where the scale is expanding exponentially every few years .
so the question i want you to ask is , if you look at this exponential curve , you &apos;re not going to go on forever .
it &apos;s not possible that everything is evolving forever and forever .
there are two options .
it either becomes a classic score like this , until something completely new is coming , or it &apos;s going to happen here .
that &apos;s something about it .
well , i &apos;m optimistic , so i think something like this is going to happen here .
it &apos;s really like that , then that means we &apos;re right here right now in the middle of a transition .
we &apos;re here on this line , in a transition from the far world to a new kind of world .
so the question i want to ask , and also a lot of myself , is how this new world will be good ?
what is this new state that &apos;s slowing down the world slowly ?
because the transition seems very , very confusing when you &apos;re in the middle of it .
when i was a kid , there was the future in 2000 , and people often talked about what would happen in 2000 .
now we have a conference here where people talk about the future , and you realize that the future still lies in 2000 .
and so far than that we don &apos;t .
so in other words , the future every year has shrinked around a year since i &apos;m in the world .
i think the reason is that we realize something is happening .
the transition happens . we can all feel .
and we know that right now it &apos;s just not a sense of trying to look at 30 or 50 years , because everything is going to be so different that a simple calculation of what we don &apos;t make a sense of .
now i want to talk about what that might be , this transition where we are right now .
and to do this , i &apos;m going to talk about some other things that really don &apos;t have anything to do with technology or computers .
because i think to really understand this , we have to take one step back and look at the thing on a long scale .
and that &apos;s what i want to look at at the time of the earth &apos;s life .
i think the full picture makes sense if you split it into some billion steps .
so let &apos;s go back , and it &apos;s 2.5 billion years . the earth was a big , sterile stockpile with many of them floating chemicals .
now , if you have the way these chemicals were organized , it gives us a pretty good picture of how they sat down .
i also think there are theories that start to understand how everything has started with rna , but i &apos;m going to tell you a very simplistic story of what is that at that time , small oil spills were floating around the different kinds of
some of these oil spills were a special combination of chemicals that allowed them to integrate other chemicals from outside and grow up .
all those were , they started to divide .
these little oil spills were the primitive cells in the sense .
however , these oil spills were not about alive in today , because every one of them was just a small , random recipe of chemicals .
and every time it divided , they have distributed chemicals to unequal chemicals .
so each event was slightly different .
in fact , the tricks , which were one for growth of optimal composition had faster than others and integrated more and more chemicals from outside and divided faster .
so these tends to survive longer , and they multiply in the vast scale .
so this is just a very simple chemical form of life , but more interestingly , if these quarries learned a trick about abstraction .
in any way that we don &apos;t quite understand , these events have learned the ability to defend information .
they learned to store the cell as a information , and it &apos;s in a particular chemical form that we call dna .
in other words , in this spiritual , evolutionary way , they found a way that allowed them to write out what they felt , so that that information could be stored and copied .
the amazing thing is that this kind of information is stored over the time of 2.5 billion years that they came in .
in fact , the recipe for us is the recipe for us , which is our genes , from exactly the same code and the same type .
and that &apos;s where every creature uses exactly the same letter and the same code .
we are so that we can only write for pleasant purpose , ourselves in this code .
and i have 100 mechanisms of a gentleman here , which i try to keep away in airports away from security staff .
in it , what i &apos;ve done is , i took this code -- the code is made of normal letters that we use to synchronize -- and i wrote my vibration on a piece of dna , and put it 10 ^ 22 .
so if somebody wants a hundred million copies of my letter , i have enough for everybody in this room and even for everybody in this world , and it &apos;s right here .
if i was actually a selfish , then i would have written them on a virus and released in the room .
so what &apos;s the next step ?
it was an interesting thing to defend dna .
and that &apos;s what wired these cells -- that makes them happy for another billion years .
but then another , very interesting step , where things were completely different , and that &apos;s why these cells started to communicate and exchange information so that communities were created by cells .
i don &apos;t know if you knew that , but bacteria can actually exchange their dna .
that &apos;s why , for example , the reason for antibiotics is growing .
some bacteria have figured out how to hold away from penicillin and put this information together with other bacteria , and now we have a lot of bacteria that are resistant to penicillin because the bacteria communicate each other .
now , this communication allowed the fact of communities which were in some sense in the same boat ; they were symbols .
so they either survived together , or they went under . that meant that if a community was successful , all the individuals of the community have been repeated more often and preferred by evolution .
now the transition is where these communities are so close to the point that they decided to write the recipe for the whole community into a symbol of dna .
and the next interesting stage took about another billion years .
at this point , we have the more expensive communities , communities of many cognitive cell necks , which are comfortable together as a single organism .
in fact , we &apos;re also such a different community .
we have a lot of cells that are no longer put on its own .
your skin cells are useless without heart cells , muscle cells , brain cells and so on .
so these communities started to evolve , so that the level that evolution happened was no longer the single cell , but the whole cell community that we call organism .
the next step happened in these communities .
the cells started to abstract information again .
and they developed special structures that did nothing else to process information within the organism .
and these are the neural structures .
so the neurons are the information processing carat , which has built these cells .
they started to train specialists within the community , special structures , which were responsible for learning , understanding and capturing information .
and this was the brain and the nervous system of these communities .
so this gave them an evolutionary advantage .
because at this point , an individual -- learning happened within the time period of one organism , instead of this evolutionary time period .
so , for example , an organism could learn to eat a certain fruit , because she liked bad , and he made him sick , the last time he eaten her .
now , this could happen within a single organism , where hundreds of thousands of years were used by years , because this information had to be learned by evolution from the individuals that died because of this information procedure .
so the nervous system has the evolution process with this particular information landscape because evolution could now occur within an individual .
she could be taking place within a timely learner .
what happened after that is that individual organisms found a way to communicate each other .
once as an example , the most detailed us of this communication system is human language .
it &apos;s a fairly amazing invention when you think about it .
i have a very complicated , distinctive and desperate idea in my head .
i &apos;m sitting here , and i &apos;m basically giving a very steady note of me in hope of creating a similar missed idea in your head that has a certain resemblance to my original idea .
so we take something very complicated , and we turn it into sound , a sequence of sound , and produces something very complicated in the heads of others .
so this allows us to do this again as an incredible organism .
and what we &apos;ve actually done , we , humanity , is we started abstract .
we &apos;re going through the same stages that have made more cell organisms -- the abstraction of our method , how we put data , present , process .
for example , the invention of language was a little step in that direction .
telephones , computers , video surroundings , c-roms and so on are all our specialized mechanisms that we built in our community to be able to handle this information .
and it connects us all together to something that is much bigger and also capable of developing faster than we were .
so today evolution can happen in microseconds at the time of microseconds .
you also saw tenny little evolutionary example where he showed a little evolution in the container program , right before your eyes .
so now we &apos;ve negotiated the time scale .
the first steps of history that i told you about is a billion years per piece .
the next steps , like the nervous system and the brain , consume a couple of hundred million years .
then the next steps , like language and so on , less than a million years .
and these next steps , like electronics , appear only for a few decades .
the process feeds itself and becomes , i think , car cataltics is the word for it -- if something increases its changes .
the more it changes , the faster it changes .
and i think that &apos;s what we see here in this explosive curve .
we see the process that feeds from itself .
i live in the building of computers , and i know that i can build the mechanism that i use to build computers , not use , without the recently advanced progress in computing technology .
my current activity is to design objects with such high complexity that it &apos;s impossible for me to design this in the traditional sense .
i don &apos;t know what every single transistor does in the material machine .
it has billions of them .
what i do instead , and what the designer of thinking mail is , we think about a certain abstract level , and the machine does something that makes our skills far better , better and faster than we could ever make it .
and it makes it part of ways that we don &apos;t even understand right now .
a method which is particularly interesting , and which i &apos;ve been using often recently , is evolution itself .
and we install an evolutionary process in the machine , which is in the microseconds .
to call an example , in the most extreme cases , we can create a program that &apos;s evolved from random instructions .
we say , &quot; computers , generally ask a hundred million randomly selected sequences of instructions .
now , all of these randomly chosen instructions , put out all the programs , and finally choose the ones which are the next . &quot;
so , in other words , i define what i want .
so let &apos;s say i want to assess numbers , which would be a simple example that i &apos;ve used for this .
so what you find is programs which can make the most stupid numbers .
of course , the chance of randomly chosen instructions is very small that they have a chance of taking numbers , so they &apos;re probably not going to actually do the instructions .
but one of them may have two numbers of lungs in the right order .
now i say , &quot; computers , take the 10 percent of the sequences that i &apos;ve come up with .
store that one , delete the rest .
now , reproducing all of the people who were best at the best level of the numbers .
and this is with a method of recommendation , analog to reproduction . &quot;
take two programs , and they produce children through the exchange of their subbines , and the children ininput the features of the subbines of the two programs .
so now i have a new generation of programs that came out by combinations of programs that have come a little closer to the presentation than others .
say , &quot; please repeat this process . &quot;
make it back again .
maybe take some mutations .
and i &apos;m trying to do this again with another generation .
all of these generations need a few milliseconds .
and so i can leave an evolution over millions of years in the computer in a few minutes , or in more complicated cases , some hours .
finally , i get programs that can be perfect perfectly .
in fact , these programs are as much more efficient than any program i could ever have written by hand .
then , when i look at these programs , i can &apos;t tell you how to work .
i tried to understand them .
it &apos;s obscure and curious programs .
but they do the job .
i know , i &apos;m sure she &apos;s doing the job because they come from a series of hundreds of thousands of programs that have done the job .
because her life depended on whether she did the job right .
i sat down in a 747 with marvin minins , and he &apos;s going to detect a map and say , &quot; oh look . look at this .
it says that this airplane is made by hundreds of thousands of small pieces that work together to make your flight safer . doesn &apos;t it make you more confident ?
we know that a developing process is not optimal when it gets too complicated .
so we &apos;re starting to leave computers , for a process , which is very different from the classical engineering of engineering .
he allows us to produce things with much higher complexity than that would allow normal ways to produce .
and yet , we don &apos;t quite understand the possibilities of that .
so technology is increasing us over the way .
we now use these programs to make the computers much faster so that we can make these processes even faster .
so it creates a feedback platform .
it gets faster and faster and i think that &apos;s why it seems so confusing .
because all of these new technologies today are feeding from themselves .
we pick up .
we &apos;ve reached at a point , the analog is at the time , as a single cell organism developed by more cell cells .
so we are the amidurs , and we can &apos;t quite figure out what the hell is about to create .
we &apos;re in the middle of this .
but i really believe that there &apos;s something else coming after us .
i think it &apos;s very high to tell us that we &apos;re the end product of evolution .
and i think all of us here are part of the creation of what &apos;s coming next .
well , lunch is before , and i think i &apos;m listening before i &apos;m going to vote .
my story starts right here in rajasthan , about two years ago .
i was under the north sky in the desert together with sufi singer murderar ali .
we talked about that nothing has changed since the ancient indian epose epideha .
if we wanted to travel indians at the time , we jumped into a car and conflicts about the sky .
now we &apos;re doing it with airplanes .
at the time , when the great indian warmer of arjna thirst had taken a bow , he took a bow , walked into the floor and water .
now we &apos;re doing this with bars and machines .
we came to the conclusion that magic and magic were replaced by machines .
i felt really sad about that .
i got some fear of technology .
it made me scare that i could lose the ability to enjoy the sunshine without camera and no tweet to my friends .
i found that technology should make magic and not kill .
when i was a little girl , my grandfather gave me his little bathroom .
this piece of 50 years old technology became the magical thing for me .
she became a golden access to a world full of pirates and unfortunate ships and images in my imagination .
i thought it was as though our fingers and cameras were dreaming about it .
they kept us inspired by this .
and so i went into the world of technology to see how i could use them to make magic rather than kill .
when i was 16 , i started to illustrate books .
when i saw the ipad , i saw it as a device for storytelling that readers can connect around the world .
it can know how to keep it .
it can know where we are .
they bring pictures and text together and animation , sound and touch .
storytelling needed more and more senses .
but what do we do about that ?
i &apos;m just going to kahaa , an interactive ipad application .
here says , &quot; put your fingers on every light . &quot;
and so -- here is , &quot; this box heard -- &quot; i write my name .
and from me , a character becomes a character .
and again , a letter goes down to me -- and the ipad knows by gps where i live -- that &apos;s right to me .
the child in me is really excited about these possibilities .
i talked a lot about magic .
i don &apos;t mean magicians and dragons , but the magic of childhood , those ideas that we all had as children .
fireflies in a glass i found really exciting .
so you have to get the ipad out here and leave the fireflies .
and they light the way through the rest of the book .
another idea that was fascinating to me as a kid is that there can be a whole galaxy in a single murder .
and so here &apos;s why every book and every world becomes a little murder that i put here in the magical device in the device .
and this opens up a map .
fantasy books always have maps , but these maps were static .
this map is growing and lit and graduated to orientation in the rest of the book .
it also shows to other places of the book .
i &apos;m going in here .
it &apos;s also important for me to make something that indian is also very time .
these are the aparas .
we &apos;ve heard all of the feathers and nonsense , but how many people outside india know their indian colleagues , the aparas ?
the poor aparas were caught for thousands of years in insurance championships , in an old buffett &apos;s book .
and we bring them back in a contemporary history for children .
it &apos;s a story that goes on to new issues , like the environmental crisis .
the environmental crisis , a big problem of the last 10 years is that children are sitting in their sales , on their computers , without going out .
but now with mobile technology , we can take our children into the natural world with their technology .
in an interaction of the book , you &apos;re sent to a search . you have to go out and collect the camera of natural objects .
as a child , i had collections of sticks , rocks , ticklls and shells .
somehow the children don &apos;t do it anymore .
this feritual is brought back . you have to go out to take a picture of a flower and tag a picture of a flower .
in another chapter , you have to photograph a piece of claws and tag a piece of cerebral .
so you actually create a digital collection of photographs that you can then put online .
a child in london shows the picture of a collection and says , &quot; oh , i &apos;ve seen a fox today . &quot;
a child in india says , &quot; i &apos;ve seen a monkey today . &quot;
this creates a kind of social network around a digital collection of photographs that you &apos;ve actually taken .
there &apos;s a number of possibilities in magic to connect the world and technology .
in the next book , we &apos;re going to make an interaction where you use the video of the ipad , and you see an animation of the ipad , and you see an animation of ivory that appears on a plant in front of the
in one place , the screen is filled with leaves .
you have to make the sound of the wind , go away and read the rest of the book .
we all move to a world where the forces of the technology are getting closer and closer to the magic and technology .
we use the energy of the sun .
we bring our children and us closer to the natural world and the magic , fun , and the love of our childhood through the simple medium of a story .
thank you .
this is really an extraordinary honor for me .
i spend most of my time working with people , prisons or death cells .
i spend most of my time with the social weakest in the social settings and places where there &apos;s a lot of hopelessness .
and being here at ted , watching and hearing how stimulating this is , gave me a lot of power .
in the short time here , i realized that ted has an identity .
you can tell things that have influence the world .
and sometimes when something comes about ted , it gets a meaning and power that otherwise it wouldn &apos;t have .
i say that because i think identity is very important .
we &apos;ve seen some fantastic presentations .
i think we &apos;ve learned that we &apos;ve learned that the words of a teacher are meaningful , but the words of a dedicated teacher is particularly meaningful .
as a doctor , you can do good . it &apos;s a doctor &apos;s doctor , but you can do more .
and so i want to talk about the power of identity .
i didn &apos;t learn that in my work as a lawyer , by the way .
i learned this from my grandmother .
i became big in a family , a traditional african american household , which was dominated by a matriarch , and that matrike was my grandmother .
she was a take , strong woman , she had effect .
she had the last word in every family argument .
it was also the start of many disabilities in our family .
she was the daughter of a slave family .
their parents were born in the 1840s in virginia as slave .
it was born by 1880 , and the experience of slavery shaped very strongly .
my grandmother was strong , but she was also loveful .
if i met her as a little boy , she came up to me and hugged me .
she struck me so hard that i could barely breathe , and then she left me .
one or two hours later , when i came up with her , she came up to me and said , &quot; bryan , do you feel my hug ? &quot;
and if i said no , she killed me again . if i said &quot; yes , &quot; she left me .
it was something that made you want to be near it .
the only problem was that she had 10 children .
my mom was the youngest of her 10 children .
sometimes when i wanted to spend time with her , it was hard to get their attention .
my cousins all around the place .
i remember i must have been eight or nine i woke up one morning and went to the living room . all my cousins around .
my grandmother was at the end of the zet , and i stared at me .
i first thought that was a game .
i looked at them and smiled , but she looked very serious .
and it went up like this 15 or 20 minutes . and then she stood up to me . she took me over and said , &quot; come , bryan . you and me , we have to talk . &quot;
i remember just like it was yesterday .
i &apos;ll never forget it .
and she took me outside and said , &quot; bryan , i &apos;m going to tell you something , but you have to promise that you don &apos;t tell it . &quot;
i said , &quot; promises , grandmother . &quot;
she said , &quot; honor ? &quot; i said , &quot; yes . &quot;
she sat down and looked at me . she said , &quot; i want you to know that i &apos;ve seen you . &quot;
she said , &quot; i think you &apos;re special . &quot;
she said , &quot; i think you can do anything you want to do . &quot;
i will never forget that .
and then she said , &quot; you &apos;ve got to promise me three things , bryan . &quot;
i said , &quot; ok , grand . &quot;
she said , &quot; first of all , you &apos;ll always love your mommy . &quot;
she said , &quot; your mom is my baby , and you have to promise you &apos;re always going to take care of them . &quot;
i worm my mother , so i said , &quot; yes , grand , i &apos;ll do that . &quot;
then she said , &quot; the next thing is that you &apos;re always going to do the right thing , &quot; even though it &apos;s hard to do the right thing .
and i thought , &quot; yes , great . i promise it . &quot;
and finally she said , &quot; the last thing you have to promise to me is you &apos;re never going to drink alcohol . &quot;
well , i was nine years old , and so i said , &quot; yes , great . i promise it . &quot;
i grew up on the country , in the old , rural south , and i have a brother who &apos;s a year older and one year younger sister .
when i was about 14 or 15 , one day my brother came home and brought this sighted beer to grab my sister and me and went to the forest .
we &apos;re just going around there like anything else .
then he took a wise beer , and he offered my sister &apos;s wife , and she took them , and then they took me on one .
i said , &quot; no , no , no . all right . just do it . i don &apos;t want a beer . &quot;
and my brother said , &quot; well , let &apos;s do that . now we &apos;re doing this , but we &apos;re still doing whatever we do .
i had something , your sister had something . go , drink a beer .
i said , &quot; i don &apos;t want . do it . just do it . &quot;
my brother died me .
he said , &quot; what &apos;s going on with you ? well , drink but what . &quot;
then he looked at me , and he said , &quot; oh no , you don &apos;t still go crazy because of the conversation with grandmother ? &quot;
i said , &quot; what are you talking about ? &quot;
he said , &quot; david tells all of us grandchildren that they &apos;re special . &quot;
i was devastated .
i &apos;ll give you something .
i probably shouldn &apos;t do that .
this may be transmitted publicly .
i &apos;m 52 years old , and i sat down that i &apos;ve never drinked a drop of alcohol .
i &apos;m not saying that because i think it &apos;s virtuous . i say that because identity means .
if we create the right kind of identity , we can tell the people around us things that they don &apos;t believe first .
we can get them to do things they thought they couldn &apos;t do .
of course , my grandmother would say all their grandchildren , they &apos;re something special .
my grandfather was in prison during the primary .
my uncle died of alcoholic disease .
and she believed these are the issues we need to take care of .
i tried to say something about our justice system .
this country is different than 40 years ago .
in 1972 , 300,000 people were in prison and in prison .
today it &apos;s 2.3 million .
the united states today has the highest immune rate of the world .
seven million people are released on convention or with an actual packaging .
in my view , masses of our world have basically changed our world .
in social weak and black parts of the population , the population despair and hopelessness , because of these changes .
one of three male blacks between 18 and 30 is in prison in prison , in prison , on convention , or with arousal degradation .
in urban communities all over the country -- los angeles about philadelphia , balalmore to washington -- are 50 to 60 percent of all black young men either in the prison , in prison , in the prison , or in the prison .
but our system is not just shaped by questions that have to do with participants , it &apos;s also designed by poverty .
we have a judge system in this country that they treat much better when they are rich and guilty than poor and innocent .
wealth , not sculpture , influence the result .
yet we seem to be totally satisfied .
a politics of fear and anger has convinced us that these problems are not our problems .
we &apos;ve lost touch .
i think that &apos;s interesting .
there &apos;s some delight developments there .
my home state of alabama makes them persistent if they &apos;re convicted .
here and today in alabama , 34 percent of male black population lost their choice .
we &apos;re predicting that in 10 years the rate of civil honor rights is going to be as high as the prevention of choice .
the silence is numb numb .
i present children .
many of my clients are very young .
the united states of america is the only country in the world that judged three year-olds to death in prison .
in this country , for children , for children , there are life-long briefties without diet .
we &apos;ve already run a lot of processes .
the only country in the world .
i make people in death cells .
the death penalty question is an interesting question .
we believe that we &apos;ve taught it so that the real question is : did a man deserve to die for one of them committed ?
that &apos;s a very sensitive question .
but you can also think differently about how we see our identity .
the other view is not : anybody deserved to death for a crime , but is it destructive , did we deserve to kill ?
that &apos;s fascinating .
the death penalty in america defines itself by error .
in nine people that we &apos;ve referred to , one of the things we &apos;ve discovered is one that we &apos;ve discovered for innocent that was degraded and made out of death .
amazing diet . one of nine innocent .
that &apos;s fascinating .
we would never let anyone fly with an airplane if they &apos;re nine planes to pick up one of them .
but somehow we make it abandoned us from this problem .
it &apos;s not our problem .
it &apos;s not our burden .
it &apos;s not our fight .
i &apos;m talking a lot about these questions .
i talk about race and the question of whether we &apos;re right to kill .
and it &apos;s exciting because i teach my students african american history . i &apos;m talking about slavery .
i &apos;m talking about terrorism , time at the end of the reconstruction , until the beginning of world war ii .
we don &apos;t really know much about it .
but for the african americans in this country , it was a time of terror .
in many areas people had to be afraid of lygurob .
or before bombs .
it was the fear of terror that shaped their lives .
now , these older people come to me and say , &quot; mr. , stevenson , you &apos;re talking , you &apos;re talking . you say the people that you should stop saying , for the first time in the history of our nation with terrorism .
they say , &quot; no -- tell the people we grew up with this . &quot;
and after terrorism , of course , the rings and decades of the rarely motivated underwear and apartheid came out .
and yet , in our country , there &apos;s a dynamics -- we don &apos;t like to talk about our problems .
we don &apos;t like talking about our history .
and that &apos;s why we don &apos;t really understand what the meaning of our action in historic context is .
we &apos;re constantly breaking together .
we &apos;re always creating new tensions and conflicts .
it &apos;s hard to talk about race , and i think that &apos;s because we &apos;re not willing to approach the process of truth and reconciliation .
in south africa , people understood that the prevention is not overcoming without the willingness for truth and reconciliation .
even after the genocide in rwanda , there were these willingness , but not in this country .
i &apos;ve given some talks in germany about the death sentence .
and it was fascinating because one of the scientists stood up after my talk and said , &quot; you know , it &apos;s deeply devastating to hear them like that . &quot;
he said , &quot; in germany , there &apos;s no death penalty .
and of course , it can never give you any more in germany .
it was very silent . then a woman said , &quot; with our history , it &apos;s impossible to talk to us ever again about people &apos;s systematic killers .
it would be a bit less , aware of us , aware of people .
i thought about it .
what it would feel like to live in a world where the german state of people made people , especially if they were in severe a lot of jews .
it would be unautonomous .
it would be sweepy .
and yet , here in this country , in the states of the old south , we &apos;re going to do people -- here &apos;s the risk of death to death , 11 times higher , if the victim is white , 22 times higher , if the
and yet , there &apos;s this mental cooperation .
i think our identity is threatened .
if we don &apos;t deal with that , with these difficult issues , the positive and wonderful things are affected as well .
we love innovation .
we love technology and creativity .
we love entertainment .
but finally , these realities are overwhelmed by suffering , abuse , interdependence , dear .
i think it &apos;s important to unite both .
because what we &apos;re talking about is that we need more hope , more engagement , more commitment , to be able to be able to be able to be in a complex world .
to me , that means to get time to think and talk about the poor , the disadvantaged , the ones that will never be at ted .
but thinking in a way that is integrated into our own lives .
we all need to believe in things that we can &apos;t see .
we do that . so rational we are , as very rational as we are .
innovation , creativity , and development is not just coming from our heads .
they come from ideas that are driven by the beliefs in our hearts .
it &apos;s this head-by-side relationship that i think is driving us , not only to be open for all the bright and determined things , but also for the dark and problematic .
vlan hael , the great cheek politician , once said .
&quot; when we fought in eastern europe against the oppression , we wanted all sorts of things . but what we needed most is hope , a mental orientation that is willing to be on hopeless places and to be witness . &quot;
this mental orientation is the core of what i think the ted communities have to engage for .
there is no distinction about technology and design that allows us to be completely human , as long as we don &apos;t have eyes and ears for poverty , vulnerability and injustice .
i want to warn you . this kind of identity demands a lot more of us than if we didn &apos;t care about it .
she &apos;s deeply touching her .
as a young lawyer , i hate the great privilege of meeting pink parks .
women parks came back to the monarchy , where they met two of their oldest friends , these elderly women , john casar , who organized the murderer busmer bombter -- an incredible african american -- and virginia , a white
so these women met , and they just stopped .
and then the woman cassinated me and said , &quot; bryan , woman parks come into the city . we want to talk .
do you want to come and listen ? &quot;
and i said , &quot; yes , very much . &quot;
she said , &quot; and what are you going to do if you &apos;re here ? &quot;
i said , &quot; i &apos;m going to listen . &quot;
and i went over and i stopped .
it was always so inspiring , so benign .
and one day i sat there and listened to these women , and after a couple of hours , woman turned to me to me saying , &quot; now bryan , tell me what the initiative is .
what do you try to achieve ? &quot;
i started with my usual talk .
i said , &quot; we &apos;re trying to move to injustice .
wr is trying to help people judge innocently .
we want to fight bias and discrimination in the delight of debris .
we want to take life to life-long destruction without children &apos;s diet .
we want to do something about the death penalty company .
we want to reduce the number of prisoners .
we want to get mass limitations . &quot;
i gave my usual talk , and after that she looked at me and said , &quot; hmm . mmm . mmm . &quot;
she said , &quot; that &apos;s going to make it very , very tired . &quot;
and then woman woke up to me , put a finger on my face and said , &quot; and so they must be very , very boring . &quot;
and so i think the ted community should be borers .
we need to find ways to address these challenges : these problems , that suffering .
because ultimately , our humanity depends on all of our humanity .
i learned very simple things in my work .
i learned a couple of simple things .
that we are all more than the worst thing we &apos;ve ever done .
i think that &apos;s true of every human being on the planet .
if someone lies , it &apos;s not just a liar .
if someone takes something that doesn &apos;t listen to him , it &apos;s not just a bow .
even who kills somebody is not just a murderer .
and because that is , there &apos;s a basic human dignity that has to respect the law .
i also believe that in many parts of this country , and certainly in many parts of the earth , the opposite of poverty is not wealthy .
i don &apos;t think so .
i think in many places the opposite of poverty is justice .
and finally , i think that even though it &apos;s so dramatic , so beautiful and inspiring , and so exciting , we &apos;re not going to be measured by our technology , not about the things that we &apos;re developing , not in our intellect
finally , a society is not going to measure how they treat their rich and powerful and privilege , but how they deal with the poor , the judgments , the instructions .
because in this context , we start to understand the truly amazing things that make us out .
sometimes i &apos;m losing the balance . a story at the end .
sometimes i get too much .
i &apos;m tired of how we all are .
sometimes these ideas predict our thinking in a very important way .
i &apos;m given these kids who were sentenced to very hard sentences .
i go to the study department , and i visit a client who may be 13 or 14 years old , and that &apos;s supposed to be an adult .
then i wonder : how could that happen ?
how can a judge turn someone into something that doesn &apos;t matter ?
the judge looked at him as adults , but i see a child .
one night i stayed up too long , and i thought , my god , if a judge can turn us into something else , then he must have magic forces .
right , brahan , the judge has magic crops .
you should wish .
and because it was late , and i couldn &apos;t really think right , i started working on a contract .
i had a 14-year-old , poor black boy than manifest .
and i started with this contract . the headline was , &quot; contract , my poor , 14-year-old black manual , like a privileged , white , 75-year-old top of top .
and in my contract , i realized that failure of the state department and police were considered to be considered .
there was a crazy line about that in this country , there was no more rights that there &apos;s only failure .
the next morning i woke up , and i didn &apos;t know if i had only dreamed of this crazy contract or actually wrote it .
and i had not just written him , but sent to the court .
a few months over and i had just forgotten everything .
and finally , i decided , my god , i have to get in the court and the crazy case .
i got into the car and i was really overwhelmed -- overwhelming .
i went to the court .
and i thought that was so hard , so painful .
eventually i went out of my car and went up to the court .
when i went up to the court , there was an elderly black man , the janitors in the court .
when he saw me , he came up to me and said , &quot; who are you ? &quot;
i said , &quot; i &apos;m a lawyer . &quot; he said , &quot; you &apos;re a lawyer ? &quot; i said , &quot; yes . &quot;
he came to me and hugged me .
and then he woke me into the ear .
he said , &quot; i &apos;m so proud of you . &quot;
and i have to say , there was force for me .
it touched something very deeply in me , identity , the ability of each one to contribute to a community , to a perspective of hope .
well , i went in the courtyard .
as soon as the judge saw me .
he said , &quot; mr. stevenson , did you put this crazy contribution ? &quot;
i said , &quot; yes . &quot; and then we started discussing .
more people came in , just because they were angry .
i wrote these crazy things .
police officers came in and accepted government lawyers and office workers .
in the hand room , the court was full of people who were angry that we talked about skin color , about poverty , about inequality .
from my eyesight , i looked up the janitors and going off .
he kept seeing through the window , and he could hear the whole obohlete .
he went up and down .
finally , this older black man came in with a very concern face , and sat behind me right behind me , almost to the defense defense .
10 minutes later , the judge quit a break .
and during the break , a police officer came in , and it destroyed that the janitor was in the court .
this deputy ranch over to the older black .
he said , &quot; jimmy , what do you do in the court ? &quot;
the older black man stood up . he looked at the deputy , and he looked at me , and he said , &quot; i &apos;ve come to say this young man , don &apos;t lose the goal from the eyes . don &apos;t give up . &quot;
i &apos;ve come to ted because i think many of them have understood that the moral pendulum of the universe is widely extended , but that it suggests justice .
that we are not completely developed as humans unless we care about human rights and values .
that all of us survive with survival of each other .
that we need to connect our visions of technology and design , of entertainment and creativity with humanity , compassion and justice .
and most of all , i want those of you who are just seeing this , just saying , don &apos;t lose the goal from the eyes . don &apos;t give up .
you &apos;ve seen in this audience , this community , and it &apos;s an obvious wish to help you and do something .
what else can we do ?
bryan stevenson : well , there are opportunities everywhere .
in california , if you live in california , there &apos;s a people in this spring where it &apos;s actually a effort to do something about the money that &apos;s going to flow into the politics of punishment .
here , in california , for example , you &apos;re going to spend a billion dollars on death sentence in the next five years , a billion dollars .
and yet , 46 percent of all the killer people don &apos;t end with an arrested .
56 percent of the speed of rapidly don &apos;t come from court .
there is a chance to do something here .
this refining is going to suggest that we invest money in more security forces and safety .
i think there are opportunities everywhere .
over the last three decades , the crime rate has gone out in america .
this is a fact that is often given to the increased instructions .
what would you tell someone who believes that ?
well , in fact , the number of criminals didn &apos;t change very much .
most of the mass masses in this country didn &apos;t really have been in the class of the violent class .
it was the lack of boundary against drugs .
and so the dramatic numbers come in the prisons .
we &apos;ve removed from the rhetoric of the punishment .
now , we have &quot; three units &quot; laws that bring people to the grid , for a bicycle for a bicycle , for the theft of fertility good , rather than giving them their power to give back the victims .
i think we need to do more to help people who have become victims of a deck , not less .
and i think our current punishment is not helping anybody .
i think that &apos;s what we need to change .
bryan , they really brought a site here to the tail .
they are an inspiring personality .
thank you for being at ted . thank you .
bin laden : bin laden makes an increased risk of risk .
famine 2 : famine in somalia . speakers 3 : peer-reviewed of the police .
a variety of dignity . speakers 5 : dangerous crossdrove ships .
6 : social discipline . speakers 7 : 65 dead .
8 : tsunami . speaker nine : cyber-attack .
different speakers : drug warden . mass destruction . tornado .
recession . silence . domestic . egypt . syria .
crisis . death . disaster .
oh , my god .
so these are just some of the clips that i &apos;ve collected over the last six months -- it could have been the last six days , or the last six years .
the fact is that the media prefer to show us negative subjects because our mind is paying attention to these subjects .
and there &apos;s a very good reason for that too .
every second every second , our senses are starting to catch a lot more information than our brain can ever process .
and because we &apos;re not more important than our survival , the first stop for all the information is part of our temporal apps , the amygdala .
so the amygdala is our early warning system , our risk .
it makes up , and it breaks all the information on the search for any and a half of our environment in our environment .
so when we see the news , we prefer to look for negative news .
and the old saying , when it blows , is very true .
well , with all of our digital devices that seven days a week , 24 hours a day , it &apos;s all these negative news , it &apos;s not a miracle that we &apos;re pessimistic .
it &apos;s not a miracle that everybody thinks that the world is getting worse .
but maybe that &apos;s not the case .
maybe that &apos;s the reality .
maybe the vast progress that we &apos;ve made in the last century is a series of forces , so strongly that it will be possible for us in the next three decades to create a world of abundance .
well , i &apos;m not saying that we don &apos;t have big problems -- climate crisis , diversity , water and energy problems -- we already have that .
and as people , we are much better at predicting problems in a very long time , but they eventually overcome .
let &apos;s see what we &apos;ve reached in the last century , so we can predict the development .
over the last 100 years , average life expectancy has more than doubled that adjusted in the inflation , adapted by the inflation of the world population .
child mortality has reduced about a tenth .
it turns out that diet and electroindity of transportation and communication costs have reduced to a scale .
steve pinker showed us that we are living in a very peaceful time of human history right now .
and according to charles keny , the english rate of 25 percent increase by 25 percent over the last 130 years .
we live in a really remarkable time .
and many people forget this .
and we increase our expectations all the time .
in fact , we redefined poverty .
remember that a great percentage of americans live under poverty , access to electricity , water , toilets , refrigerators , tv , tv phones , mobile phones , air phones and cars .
the richest capitalists of the last century , the imperative of the earth , would never have dreamed of such luxury workers .
the basis of a lot of these forms technologies , and these grow expolarating .
my good friend ray kurzweil has shown us that every tool that is going to become information technology on the curve of moore &apos;s law , makes the price performance rate every 12 to 24 months .
that &apos;s why the mobile phone in your pocket costs about a million times less and is a thousand times faster than a supercomputer from the &apos; 70s .
now look at this curve .
this is moore &apos;s law for the last hundred years .
notice two things on this curve .
first of all , how much does it avoid -- in good times of bad times , war or peace , recession , depression and high junk .
this is the result of fast computers building faster computers .
it slows down to none of our big problems .
also , despite their logarithmic rising on the left , they walk upwards .
so the growth rate itself is speeding up .
and on this curve , on the back of moore &apos;s law , we find a series of extraordinary technologies that are available .
&quot; cloud computing , &quot; something that my friends of automobile computing call &quot; infinite computing , &quot; sensors and networks , robots , 3d printers that allow it to democratize personal production on our planet , synthetic biology ,
how many of you have seen the victory of ibm supercomputer at risk ?
that was great .
i took the newspapers , and i looked for the best headlines i could find .
i love this : &quot; watson drives human enemy . &quot;
risk is not a simple game .
it &apos;s about understanding the nuances of language .
imagine that these artificial intelligence provides every owner of a mobile phone .
four years ago , ray kurzweil , and i showed here at ted a new university called singularity university .
we bring our students all over these technologies , with special focus on how this can be used to solve the great challenges of humanity .
and every year we ask the students to create companies and services and services that can be able to impact in a decade the life of billions of people .
think about that a group of students can affect life from billions of people today .
30 years ago , this would be ridiculous .
today we can put in dozens of companies that have done exactly this .
when i think about creating abundance , i don &apos;t mean a life of luxury for everyone on this planet ; it &apos;s about creating a life full of possibilities .
it &apos;s about creating goods of good surplus .
the scarcity is contextual , and technology is a resource free .
here &apos;s an example .
this is the story of npoleon iii in the middle of the 18th century .
he &apos;s the guy on the left .
he invited the king of siam to dinner .
the napleons of soldiers got silver best , npole self had gold brick .
the king of siam got aluminum brack .
aluminum was the most valuable metal on the planet , more valuable than gold and plain .
this is why the dome of the area of what was made from aluminum is aluminum .
even though aluminum takes 8.3 percent of the natural mass , it &apos;s not going to be a pure metal .
it &apos;s connected by oxygen and silicon .
but then the technology of the electrolygraphy was developed and made aluminum production so cheap that we use it with our surveillance .
then let &apos;s put this analogy into the future .
we &apos;re thinking about energy scarcity today .
ladies and gentlemen , we live on a planet of 5,000 times more energy than we use a year .
16 terabytes of energy squeeze all 88 minutes on earth &apos;s surface .
it &apos;s not about scarcity , the problem is accessible .
and there &apos;s good news .
this year , for the first time , you &apos;ve managed to reduce the cost of solar electricity to 50 percent of the solar electricity -- 888 rupees compared to 17 rupees .
the cost of solar energy dropped by 50 percent last year .
this has last month published with a study that shows that until the end of this decade in the sunny areas of solar energy six cents a kahh , it &apos;s going to cost to 15 cents at the national average .
and if we have a energy translation , we will also have water in the abundance .
let &apos;s talk about water wars .
remember , when carl sagan was the voyager space vehicle in 1990 , when it was moved on saturn , turned back towards earth ?
he took a famous photograph . what was it about ?
&quot; a pack blue dot . &quot;
because we live on a water planet .
we live on a planet that &apos;s 70 percent of water .
yes , it &apos;s 97th percent saline , two percent are traveled , and we &apos;re fighting about 0.5 percent of the water on the planet , but here is hope .
and there are new technologies , not in 10 or 20 years , but now .
it &apos;s new nanotechnology on the way , nano-materials .
and from a conversation this morning with dean kaman , one of the innovators of the document of boy , i want to share with you -- he gave me the permission -- his neighbor called the slash , and many of you may
it can create clean drinking water a day from different sources -- whether saltwater , polluted water , latrine -- and all that for less than two cents a liter .
now , the president of coca-cola has just launched a big test project with a hundred units in the developing world .
and if everything goes well , and i &apos;m very confident , coca-cola is going to apply this technology global in 206 countries around the planet .
this is technology support innovation that exists today .
and we &apos;ve seen this in mobile phones as well .
oh my god , we &apos;re going to get the 70 percent reduction of mobile phones in the developing world to the end of 2013 .
just think that an masai warrior with a cell phone in the middle of kenya has a better mobile communication than president reagan 25 years ago .
and if you search with your smartphone on google , you have more access to knowledge and information as president clinton , 15 years ago .
they live in a world that has information and communication in the surroundings , like nobody could ever predict .
and it gets better , the things that you and i &apos;ve spent several thousand dollars -- gps , developing video and photographs , libraries full of books and music , technology to medical diagnostics -- are now literally promoted and cheaper
and the best thing about this is perhaps what &apos;s expected to do in health .
in the last month , i had pleased the pleasure , with the source foundation , to announce the so-called $ 10 million chemical routx x prize .
we challenge teams all over the world to connect all these technologies together in a mobile phone that you can talk to the device , because it &apos;s equipped with ki , you can test a hurrain or your blood vessels .
and to win , the device has to make a better diagnostic as a team of highly qualified doctors .
imagine this device . in the middle of a developing country , where there are no doctors , but 25 percent of the disease &apos;s disease and 1.3 percent of the employees of healthcare .
if this device sequences a rna or a dna virus that is not known , it requires the health service and prevents a pandemic in front of it .
but now the biggest force that &apos;s going to lead us to a world of abundance .
i call it &quot; the coming billion . &quot;
the white lines represent the population .
we just crossed the seven-billion brand .
and only by the way , the greatest insurance against a population explosion is better education and diet around the world .
in 2010 , we were just connected to each other among two billion people online .
by 2020 , we &apos;re increased by two to five billion internet users .
three billion new heads we &apos;ve never heard before are going to join global communication .
what do these people need ?
what will they consume ? what will they want ?
and instead of economic reports , i see one of the greatest economic minds of history .
these people represent several trillion dollars that are going to flow into the global economy .
and they &apos;re going to become healthier , and they get better trained by the khan-academy , and by putting the opportunity to get 3d printers and &quot; infinite computing , &quot; and as much more productive than ever before .
so what can three billion growing , healthy , educated , productive members of the human community ?
how about a sentence of new , never before heard ?
so what about the oppressed , wherever you are , to give a voice to make a voice and make a difference , for the first time ?
what are these three billion people going to bring together ?
what about contributions that we can &apos;t even predict ?
one of the things that i &apos;ve learned through the x prize is that small teams that are motivated by passion and focus can create extraordinary things , things that could only create big companies and governments in the past .
i want to conclude with a story that really got me excited .
there &apos;s a program that some may know already .
it &apos;s a game called the fold .
it was developed at the university of washington in seattle .
and it &apos;s a game where people can take a sequence of amino acids to explore how the protein is going to develop .
we can predict the structure and function in its behavior .
and this is very important in medical science .
so far , this was a problem for supercomputers .
and this game was played by university professors and so on .
and there are now hundreds of thousands of people playing the game online .
and it showed that today &apos;s human pattern recognition is better folding the protein than the best supercomputers .
and when these people came and looked at who was the best protein company in the world , this was not a professor , not a caltech student , it was someone from england , manchester , a woman who was working on the day as an
ladies and gentlemen , which gives me enormous trust in our future is the fact that we have more power than individuals to put us in the great challenges of our planet .
we have access to tools with exponential technology .
we have the passion of a diy innovator .
we have the capital of techn philanthropy .
and we have three billion new minds that we can work with online to master the new challenges , and to do what &apos;s needed .
we &apos;re expecting a couple of extraordinary decades .
thank you .
i think we need to deal with something about a transformational piece of medical culture .
and i think it starts with a medical doctor , and i am .
and maybe i &apos;ve been in business for quite a long time than i can allow it to give me a piece of my own false pricing to make this happen .
before i come to the real issue of my talk , let &apos;s start with a little baseball .
hey , why not ?
we &apos;re close to season and we move to the world curse .
we all love baseball , right ?
baseball is full of great statistics .
and there are hundreds of them .
&quot; monetball &quot; seems to appear and turn around statistics and to use this to use a great baseball team .
i &apos;m going to take on a statistic that i hope most of you have heard before .
it &apos;s the average performance of the god .
we &apos;re talking about a 300 , if a lump of 300 beats .
that means that the player is sure three of 10 beats beat up .
that &apos;s going to beat the ball in the outside field , he &apos;s up , he &apos;s not caught , and who &apos;s trying to throw the ball to first basket , didn &apos;t make it in time , and the banker was in safety .
three out of 10 .
do you know how to call a 300 in major league baseball ?
good , really good , maybe a solar star .
do you know how to call a 400ter one ?
this is somebody who is in the rest of the 10 out of 10 .
legacy -- like ted williams legarctica -- the last masjory league in baseball players had met over 400 times over the course of a regular season .
let &apos;s go back to my world of medicine , where i feel a lot of well-being , or maybe a little bit less than i &apos;ve talked to you about this .
suppose you have a blind flash of flash , and you &apos;re proposing to an operator whose average performance is 400 in terms of blindness .
somehow that doesn &apos;t work , right ?
suppose they live in a certain remote area , and they have a lovely human carrot , and their house agencies are presenting this to a cartoon , whose average performance is at the exhibition at 200 .
but , you know what ?
she &apos;s much better this year . she &apos;s at the top .
and she &apos;s beating a 257 .
somehow that doesn &apos;t work .
but i &apos;m going to ask you a question .
what do you think like the average performance for a cartoonist or a nurse or a orthopedic , should be an 11-year-old to be a regenerative ?
1,000 , very good .
the truth is that no one in all the medicine knows what a good surgeon or doctor should be regenerative .
but what we do is we embed each of them , including me , to be perfect in the world .
never make a mistake , but nobody &apos;s thinking about the details of how this should be done .
and this is the message i took in medical school .
i was a obsessed student .
once a student said , brian golden would learn brian golden for a blood test .
and it did .
and i learned in my little root in the sisters of resistance of the toronto general hospital , unfar from here .
i learned everything .
in my anatomy , i learned the origins and the volume of every muscle , every single art of any artery , which leads to the aorta , obstacle and ordinary differential diagnostics .
i even knew the differential diagnostic to classify relevant tuberculosis .
and the whole time i collected more and more and more .
and i was good , i put car lauren off .
and i left the medical school with the impression that if i knew everything , and i knew everything , or at least as much as possible , as close as possible , that i &apos;m immune to the power of mistakes .
and it worked for for a while until i met woman printers .
i reserved at a school school here in toronto as a woman to me in the emergency department of the hospital .
at that time , i was proposed to the cardigraphic layer in the cardigraphic service .
and it was my mission when the emergent car prosthetic advice was to study the emergency patient .
and give feedback to my battery .
i examined women printers , and she was in breath .
and when i listened to her , they made oyster sounds .
and when i stopped her chest with the stethoscope , i could hear a snapshot of sound on both sides , which told me she suffered under depression .
this is a state in which the heart fails , instead of pumping the entire blood further , puts part of the blood in the lung , and it &apos;s coming out of that , and that &apos;s why the display was coming .
and that wasn &apos;t a hard time diagnosing .
i hired her and made it to treatment .
i gave her aspiration . i gave her medicine to take the pressure from the heart .
i gave her medicine that we call diagnostics , water pills , so that she left the liquid .
and over a period of one and a half hours , she started feeling better .
i felt really good .
and i made my first mistake ; i sent them home .
actually , i made two mistakes .
i sent them home without talking to my vegetarians .
i didn &apos;t take the audience and did what i should have , which would have been a call on my battery to take it off with him so that he had a chance to make a personal picture .
and he knew her , he would have been able to control more information to her .
maybe i did good reason .
maybe i didn &apos;t want to be the helpful doctor .
maybe i wanted to succeed so much and so capable of taking the responsibility that i was like that , and so i would be able to worry for my patients without having to contact it .
my second mistake was worse .
so that i sent them home , i missed a little voice in me who tried to say to me , &quot; goldman , no good idea . don &apos;t do that . &quot;
in fact , it was so much for me to say that i asked the nurse , which was about woman printers , &quot; do you think it &apos;s okay when you go home ? &quot;
and the nurse thought about it , and the nurse said , &quot; yeah , i think it &apos;s going to go good . &quot;
i remember as if it was yesterday .
so i signed the envelope , and i came up with a nurse and a redosalted , and then brought them home .
and i went back to work .
the rest of the day , the night i had this close feeling in my stomach .
but i continued working .
and at the end of the day , i grabbed my stuff , got the hospital and went to the parking room to drive the car home when i did something i didn &apos;t make .
i went home from the emergency room on my way home .
and there said another nurse , not the sister who saw the woman printer , but another three words to me , and those three words fear the most non-religious people i know .
other medical scientists fear these as well , but the emergency room is particularly because we see the patient just so powerful .
the three words : remember ?
&quot; remember the patients you were sending home ? &quot;
the nurse disappeared .
&quot; so she &apos;s back , &quot; she said in this particular proposition .
so she was back .
she was back and dying .
about an hour after she got home , after i sent her home , she collapsed , and the family called 911 . the rehabilitation took them back to the emergency station with a blood pressure of 50 , which is an dangerous shock .
they were barely breathing , and they were running blue .
the novelty moved all the strands .
they gave their blood rate to their blood rate .
they closed them down to the beating machine .
i was shocked , and i was shocked into the inside .
and i lived this rollercoaster , because she came to the substance of intensive care , and i was hoping that she would recover .
and after two , three days realized she never knew that she was going to awaken again .
she had not suffered a treatable of the brain .
her family gathered .
and over the course of eight or nine days , they gave them a gift .
the new day they flew them -- wife printers , a woman , a mother and grandmother .
you &apos;re saying that you can never forget the names of the names .
and that was the first time i learned this myself .
the next weeks i did , and i learned for the first time , the unhealthy shame that exists in our medical culture -- i felt alone , isolated , not the kind of healthy shame that you feel because you can &apos;t talk to the
you all know the healthy shame , if you give a secret to the best friend of the prize , even though it falls down on bottles , and you &apos;re going to get the best friend to confront , and you have a terrible
if you take revenue and never make the mistake again .
this is the kind of fake shame .
the unhealthy way i &apos;m talking about is the one that makes one sick .
it &apos;s the one who says that that &apos;s not what you &apos;re doing badly , but you &apos;re bad .
and that &apos;s what i felt .
and it wasn &apos;t my doctor &apos;s reason , he was very love .
he talked to the family , and i &apos;m sure he was the begging grid , and sure that i wasn &apos;t shifting .
but i kept asking these questions .
why didn &apos;t i ask the vegetable ? why did i send them home ?
and then in my worst moments : how could i make a domestic mistake ?
why am i going to medicine ?
slowly , but certainly it made .
i started feeling better .
and then on a piece of day , there was a hole in the clouds and the sun broke down , and i might tell me , maybe i could feel better again .
and i was with me that if i double my efforts to perfection , and never again suggested that the voice could be compromised .
and she did .
and i continued to work .
and then it happened again .
two years later , i had service in the emergency station in a column hospital north of toronto , and i took a 25-year-old man with bold rocket .
it was a lot of go and me .
he always showed up here .
i looked in the rock , and it was a little bit pink .
and i gave him a prescription of penicillin and sent him back .
and even when he went out of the door , he showed him on his rock .
two days later , i came to my next emergency room , and my chemotherapy asked me to talk to her office .
and she said the three words : do you remember ?
&quot; do you remember the patients with the dry rocket ? &quot;
it turned out that he &apos;s an alarming infection .
he had a potentially life-threatening disease called epiglry .
you can googling , but it &apos;s not an infection of the rock , but the top breath and causes the crops .
and fortunately , he didn &apos;t die .
he got intuitive antibotery , and he got a few days later .
and i went back through the same trace of shame and self-doubt , and i felt disconnected and went to work until it came back and again and again .
in an emergency class , i &apos;ve seen two times a flash of flash of flash .
there &apos;s a lot of it , especially when you think you &apos;re working in a hospital that had only 14 patients a night .
in both cases , i didn &apos;t send them home , and there was no imperfections in their treatment either .
in one thought , i thought he would have kidney bone .
i put the x-ray of the kidney . when that was without the bus , my colleague at the reception of the patient was determined a detector in the lower right sector and called the operator .
the other one had strong diarrhea .
i rotated fluid to recover him , and i asked my colleagues to listen to him as well .
and he did , and when he determined a delay in the right lower sector , he called the operator .
and in both cases , operated , and they were good at them .
both cases were at me , freaking me up .
and i would be happy to tell you that my worst mistakes only happened in the first five years , which is what many of my colleagues claim , but total nonsense .
some of my clips happened over the last five years .
alone , shameless , and without support .
here &apos;s the problem : if i don &apos;t end up with my mistakes and talk about them , if i can talk to the quiet voice , which is what really happened , how can i share it with my colleagues ?
how can i teach them my mistakes so that they &apos;re not the same ?
if i go into a room -- like right now , i have no idea what you think about me .
when did you hear the last time you heard about a failure of failure on failure ?
oh yeah , you go to a cocktail party , and you may hear about any doctor , but you won &apos;t hear someone talking about your own mistakes .
if i went into a room full of colleagues , and asked for their immediate support , and let them tell them what i just told you , i would not get to the end of the second story before they were really uncomfortable , anybody
and in fact , if i knew or my colleagues would know that a sub-saharan place in my hospital would take someone wrong , then believe me , i would have trouble looking in the eyes .
that &apos;s the system we live in .
it &apos;s an absolute denial of mistakes .
it &apos;s a system where there are two basic positions -- those who make mistakes and those who are doing no doubt , those who constitute the sleep , and without limitation , with bad results and with good results .
it &apos;s almost an ideological reaction like antibodies that attack people .
and there &apos;s the idea that if we make those who make mistakes from medicine , that we remain a safe system .
but there are two problems .
in my about 20 years of medicine and journalism , i created a personal medical study about medical errors and wrong treatments for all of my first paper that i was writing for the toronto star to my show , &quot; white coat , black way
and what i learned is that mistakes are absolutely uncomfortable .
we &apos;re working in a system every day , where one of 10 medications is either a false or wrong , in which hospitals are getting more and more rich and more rich and devastating or dead .
in this state , about 24,000 canadians are dying of sacred mistakes .
in the united states , the institute of medicine put the number 100,000 .
both of these are strong undergrades because we don &apos;t consider the problem as well as we should .
and is the crx .
in a hospital system where medical knowledge is double every two to three years , we can &apos;t stop .
sleeping is ubiquitous .
we can &apos;t get rid of it .
we have a cognitive error , so that we can take a perfect disease for a patient with chest pain .
and then i take the same patient with chest pain , and i make it protected and switched and just give you a slightly alarming breath about it , and suddenly the story is translated with contempt .
i don &apos;t take the same line .
i &apos;m not a robot ; i &apos;m not always doing things .
and my patients are not cars ; they don &apos;t always tell me their symptoms in the same way .
all of that summaries are misevided .
so , if you take the system as i was taught , and you made all the miserable health food , then no one &apos;s left at the end .
and you know the versions of people who don &apos;t want to talk about their worst cases ?
in my show , &quot; white coat , black way , &quot; i &apos;ve got the habitat to say , &quot; this is my worst mistake , &quot; i would say to each of the refugees to the bag of car logging , &quot;
and then their pupils are moving , they went out front of their head , and they &apos;re going down and looking hard , and they start telling their stories .
you want to tell your stories . you want to share your stories .
they want to be able to say , &quot; look , don &apos;t make the same mistakes i &apos;ve been making . &quot;
what they need is an environment that is able to put it in the situation .
what you need is a new medical culture .
and it starts with a doctor .
the new defined doctor is a human , knows about his humanity , accepting them , is not proud to make mistakes , but put everything out of them , so that it can be passed on .
she shares her experience with others .
it supports when other people talk about their mistakes .
and she shows other people &apos;s mistakes , not to show , but in a lovely , supportive way that all of them benefit .
and she works in a medical culture that recognizes that people fill the system with life , and if that &apos;s like that , people also make errors from time to time .
and so the system is going to develop bakeps that make it easier to find errors that make people inevitable and also create lovely , supportive spaces where anyone who is looking at healthcare , can actually address things that potential mistakes are ,
my name is brian goldman .
i &apos;m the new defined doctor .
i &apos;m a person . i make mistakes .
i belong that , but i &apos;m trying to learn from trying to give it to others .
i don &apos;t know what you &apos;re holding , but i can live with that .
let me close with three of my own words : i remember .
i &apos;m going to talk about a tiny , small idea .
it &apos;s about transformative normes .
and because you can explain this idea in a minute , i &apos;ll tell you three stories about using time .
the first story is charles darwin , one of my heroes .
you know he was 183 .
you may think that he &apos;s paying attention , but that &apos;s not true .
in fact , he collected fish .
he described one of them as a very typical .
it was a grassroots .
until the &apos; 80s , he was caught in big style .
now it &apos;s on the red list of endangered species .
this is a story that we &apos;ve heard many times from the galapagos or from other places , it &apos;s not very special .
yet , we still come on the galapagos .
we still think they &apos;re originally .
the broaders are still describing them as pristine .
what happened here ?
the second story is going to be a different concept , which is the transformative vulnerability .
because i experienced it when i studied a lagoa in west africa in 1971 .
i went there because i grew up in europe and i wanted to work later in africa .
i thought i could integrate .
and i got a bad sunband , and i was convinced that i didn &apos;t really get out of there .
it was my first sunbrand .
as you can see , the lagos of palms and some mangroves turned around .
there were the submissions of about 20 centimeters , black bugs , a subway of the grid .
the fisheries of these gridets were very remaining , and the fishermen lived well and made the fishermen above average , above average .
when i got back 27 years later , the fish was shredded down to half its size .
they &apos;re five inches old .
they were genetically shaped .
there were still fish .
people were still happy .
and the fish was also fortunate to be there .
so nothing changed , and yet everything changed .
my third little story tells me about my collaborator at the introduction of the puppy in southern asia .
in the &apos; 70s -- rather than the beginning of the &apos; 60s -- europe proved many development projects .
fishing is the countries that have already 100,000 fish , the industrial fishing of this pretty ugly ship is called mutiara 4 .
i drove on it , and we made risks throughout the southern south sea and particularly in the junk sea .
we had no words for what we started there .
i know now that it was the bottom of the ocean .
90 percent of our starts were the collapses , other animals , which are connected to the reason .
the biggest part of the fish , the little dots there on the debt , the debt , were coral reefs .
in essence , the ocean of the ocean came down and was then thrown back .
these pictures are extraordinary because the transition goes very quickly .
within a year , you take a survey through and start with the commercial fishing .
the reason is changed . out of -- in this case -- a hard ground or soft coral becomes a match crash .
this is a dead turtle .
they didn &apos;t eat , they threw them away because they were dead .
once we did a living .
she wasn &apos;t dropped yet .
then they wanted to kill them , because you could eat them good .
in fact , this mountain of debt is accumulated every time by fishing , when they drive in areas where they &apos;ve never been hacked .
it &apos;s not going to document .
we change the world , but we don &apos;t remember it .
we adapt our values to the new level , and we don &apos;t remind ourselves what was there .
if you generalize it , this is what happens .
on the y-axis , some good things : biodiversity , number of orbit , the green of their country , the water printer .
and over time it changes . it changes , because for the people their actions are natural .
every generation looks at the images that they take up at the beginning of their conscious life , as standard and will leave all of it .
the difference is then perceived as a loss .
but you don &apos;t have the previous losses true .
there can be a order of change .
and at the end of the end , you just want to get the commercial remains .
that &apos;s the way our goal is now .
we want to get things that are disappeared or things that are no longer what they were .
now you might think that the problem of people who were sure when they were living in predators in predators , killed animals and had been aware of just a few generations what they had done .
because obviously an animal , which was very common , was only rarely before it dies .
so you don &apos;t lose a very common animals .
you always lose rare animals .
and that &apos;s why it &apos;s not seen as a big loss .
and over time , we &apos;re focusing on the big animals and the ocean , and the big fish are the big fish .
they become less rare because we start them .
and over time , there are little fish left , and we think that &apos;s the norm .
the question is why people accept this .
well , because they don &apos;t know it was different .
of course , a lot of people , scientists , will confirm that it was really different .
they will confirm it because the evidence of how they promote in an earlier form are not as they would like to represent the evidence .
so , for example , there &apos;s anecantes that , for example , that the report of the capuchin capuchin , which can &apos;t be used in this area , can &apos;t be used , or usually not being used by fishery scientists ,
so we have the situation that people don &apos;t know the past , even though we live in educated societies because they don &apos;t trust the sources of the past .
this shows the tremendously large role that can play a marine protected area .
because of marine reserve , we &apos;re basically putting the past back .
we make the past come back that people can &apos;t understand , because the normes have changed and very low .
and so the people who see a marine protected area can benefit from the insight that allows it to reset their values .
what about the people who are not possible , because they don &apos;t have access -- the people in the middle west , for example ?
so here i think the art and the film may fill the gap , and simulations .
this is the simulation of chesapeake bay .
there were gray whales a long time ago -- 500 years ago .
and the blindness and the -- you might remember the avatar of &quot; avatar . &quot;
if you think about &quot; avatar , &quot; if you think about why people were being touched by this -- apart from the panahline story , why were they so touched by the image world ?
because there &apos;s something chamatically lost in a certain way .
so my recommendation , the only thing i &apos;m going to give , is going to cameron , so he turns under water , &quot; avatar ii . &quot;
thank you .
if you had a typewriter in the &apos; 80s , in the communist east germany , if you had a typewriter , it had to be registered by government .
they also had to read a leaf with example from this typewriter .
the reason for that is , the government could track where a text came from .
they came up with an article with wrong thought , and they could feel the creator of this thought .
and in the west , we couldn &apos;t understand how anyone could do something like this , and how much that would confirm the speech freedom .
in our own countries , we would never do something like that .
but if you buy a new black bombsight in 2011 , you can buy a new black footprint from the leading readers and print one page , and that side of bright yellow bars put up on each side , in a pattern that is
this is happening today .
and no one seems to be alive about that .
and that was an example of our own governments to use technology against us , citizens .
and this is one of the three sources of today &apos;s existing problems .
let &apos;s look at what really happens in the world : we can split the attacks in categories .
we have three main groups .
there are online criminals .
for example here , this is mr. diimherry homfellow from milw in ukraine .
and the motivation of online criminals are very easy to understand .
these people make money .
they use online attacks to make a lot of money , a huge amount of money .
there are several known cases of online millionaire , mirrors , who deserved their money by attacks .
this is sea sants from dariu in estonia .
this is alfred gridlock .
stephen watts .
bjorn pinin .
these are matthew anderson , monitor al-qaeda and so on and so forth .
these people have come to wealth online , but they put it illegal by using djane money to chase money out of our banks , while we do our online bank , or also the chickens who collected our credit cards at the
the u.s. american intelligence service two months ago the swiss account of mr. sam jin here , and on this account were 14-year-old million u.s. dollars when it was frozen .
mr. jin himself is on free foot , the contents are unknown .
and i claim that it &apos;s more likely today that we become victims of an online crime than a crime in the real world .
and it &apos;s very obvious that this is going to be even worse .
in the future , most crime will play online .
the second largest group that we can see today is not motivated by money .
they &apos;re motivated by something else -- protest , in opinion , or by their audience .
groups like anonymous have been up over the last 12 months and became one of the main players in the field of online attacks .
so these are the three primary groups : criminals that do it for money , hackers like anonymous , but the last group are nations , governments , who run the attacks .
that &apos;s where the diet . that &apos;s the diliament .
it shows you what happens when governments attack their own citizens .
diiozar is a full-scale desertification from the netherlands -- or it was .
in the last fall , it had to be in violence , because diliging was hacked .
someone was broken , and the system was hacked .
and last week in a meeting with dutch government students , i asked one of the leaders of this group to ask the question of if he thought it was possible because of the diagram of the diagnosis .
and his answer was yes .
now , how do people die in a hack like this ?
diiozar is an organic accident .
they sell certificate .
what do you do with kilanthrot ?
now , a certificate , if you have a website with a tape , has fucking services , for example , gilil , for example .
now we all use , or a lot of us , gilil or one of their competitors , but these services are particularly common in rural states like iran , where dissidents are using the grace , because they know that they can trust more
but if you go to a foreign foreign .
it &apos;s an accurate firm and faithful bias .
and this is exactly what happened in diliament .
what about the arab spring and the things that have happened in egypt for example ?
well , in egypt , the insurgency in april , 2011 , was the head quarter of the egyptian secret police officers , and they found a lot of records .
in those records , a certificate was called &quot; character . &quot;
and in this context , notes were in a broader company in germany , who had sold the egyptian government with a couple of programs that they had -- in very large frames -- to prevent any communication of egyptian citizens .
they had sold this program for 280,000 euros to the egyptian government .
the company quarter is right here .
so western governments provide peaceful governments with tools so that they can prevent their own citizens .
but western governments also help themselves .
for example , in germany , just a couple of weeks ago , in germany , it was found by the so-called state mines , which was a trojan that was used by german government funds to flourish their own citizens .
if you &apos;re suspicious in a crime crisis , almost safely your phone is applied to your phone .
but today we are far beyond that .
they are taping up their internet connection .
they use resources like the state of state to visit their computers with a djane that allows them to monitor their entire communication , listen to their online discussions , to raise their passions .
so if we think about things like this , the obvious answer to people would be , &quot; ok , that sounds bad , but it &apos;s not because i &apos;m a brown citizen .
i don &apos;t have to worry .
i have nothing to hide . &quot;
and that argument doesn &apos;t make any sense .
privacy has got to be given .
privacy is not the debate .
it &apos;s not a decision between privacy and security .
it &apos;s a decision between freedom and control .
and while we &apos;re today , in 2011 , we may trust our governments , but every right we &apos;re going to leave , for every single year .
and we trust , we blindly trust one future government , a government that we may have in fifty years ?
these are the questions that we have to deal with for the next 50 years .
it may seem strange to you , but i &apos;m a big fan of pitch blocks .
the first pitch blocks were made in 1868 , and it came up with a simple idea : mosquitos of cement with distributed devices that fit together .
concrete stones became very quickly the most common building unit in the world .
they put us in the position of building things that were bigger than us , buildings , bridges , one stone after another .
essentially , the concrete stone has become the building block of our time .
almost a hundred years later , in 1947 , lego came out .
it was called automatically connected stone .
and within a few years , lego took place in every household .
it &apos;s estimated that over 400 billion stones have been produced -- or 75 stones for every person on this planet .
they don &apos;t have to be an engineer to create beautiful houses , beautiful bridges or beautiful buildings .
lego made it possible for everybody .
lego basically took the concrete stone , the building block of the world , and made a building block for our imagination .
in the meantime , in the same year at the bell lake , announced the next revolution , the next building block .
the transistor was a little bit of plastic that would take us from a world of static , on multiple building blocks to a world in which everything was interactive .
like the block , we allow the transistor to build much larger , complex circles , one stone after another .
but there &apos;s a main case : the transistor was only for experts .
i personally accept that the building block of our time is reserved for experts , and so i decided to change this .
eight years ago , i was at the media lab , and i started to explore this idea of how to put the power of engineers into the hand of artists and designers .
a couple of years ago , i started to develop education .
let me show you how they work .
subjects are electronic mosquitos who have specific function .
they are proposed , light , sound , motor and sensor .
and the best part is they connect with magnets .
you can &apos;t put them together wrong .
the rocks are colorha .
green is empathy , blue is electricity , pink is embedded and orange is wires .
all they need to do is connect a blue and a green one , and they can build larger circles very quickly .
they add a blue blue blue , and they can make light .
you can put a switch in between , and so you made a little stick .
take the switch out around a pulse , which is here , add up , and you made a little flinker .
so , add this buzz for an extra effect , and they made a tail machine .
i &apos;ll stop it .
and beyond the simple play , reading material is actually pretty powerful .
instead of having to program , they have to program , wired or solve , to program them with simple , intuitive gestures .
so to speed up the flash or slow down , just turn on that button , and it makes the impulse faster or slow .
the idea behind subjects is that it &apos;s a growing library .
we want to bring every single interaction on this world into a scary stone .
lights , notes , sorere , motors -- everything should be available .
we &apos;ve spread subjects to children and see them playing with it .
and it was an incredible experience .
the most beautiful thing is , how do you start to understand the electronics that you &apos;re talking about in the day and you don &apos;t learn at school .
like , for example , a nightlight works , or why the doors remain open , or like an ipod reacting to touch .
we also brought principles of creativity to design .
so , for example , we had designers with no experience in electronic things that started playing with subjects as materials .
here we see , with movie , paper and water bottles , like georges ...
a couple of weeks ago , we brought principles to risd , and we gave them some designers that had no technical experience -- just cardboard , wood and paper -- and told them , &quot; do what . &quot;
here &apos;s an example of a project they did , a moving conference cannon .
but wait , this is really my favorite project .
it &apos;s a phrase from clay , which has fear in darkness .
for these non-profit engineers , tradition became another material , electronics just became another material .
and we want to make this material available to everyone .
so creativity opens up open source .
you can go to the website , download all the design and make them yourself .
we want the world of creators , the inventor who encourages joining , because this world that we live in , this interactive world , is ours .
so , pull it down and start inventing .
thank you .
